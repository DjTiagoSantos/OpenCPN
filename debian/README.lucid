The current packaging depends on libtinyxml-dev, which does not exist in
debian prior to Squeeze nor Ubuntu prior to Maverick.

To build on Ubuntu Lucid (et al.), you'll have to edit the
debian/patches/series file and remove the use_pkg_tinyxml.patch line,
edit debian/rules and stop the tinyxml and tinystr files from being
deleted, and edit the debian/control file and remove the build-depends
on libtinyxml-dev.

Then it will build as expected, using the embedded local copy.
