-.SH PLUGIN LOADING
-
-Plugin loading depends on that the opencpn main program can locate the
-plugin object file and that the plugin can locate it's own data.
-.P
-On Linux, the main program searches for plugin .so-files in a library
-named \fIopencpn/plugins\fR.
-By default, this path is searched in ~/.local/lib:/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib.
-The default search path can be overridden by the OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS
-environment variable.
-.P
-On other platforms, all plugin object files lives in a single directory
-defined at installation.
-.P
-A plugin's data directory is a path ending with
-\fIopencpn/plugins/<plugin_name>\fR.
-On Linux, this is by default searched in
-~/local/share:/usr/local/share:/usr/share.
-This search path is overridden by XDG_DATA_DIRS as defined by the freedesktop
-spec.
-Only plugins adapted for this (i. e., using GetPluginDataDir()) handles this
-properly.
-.P
-On other platforms, the plugin data directories always lives in a common
-parent defined at installation time.
-
-.SH NOTES
-
-The support for OPENCPN_PLUGIN_DIRS and XDG_DATA_DIRS was introduced in
-version TBD. Prior to this, all plugins was loaded from a single directory
-and all plugin data directories had a common parent.
