Comment: Dave Register (OpenCPN lead author) wrote:
 "We could use libgdal, with what I would call "moderate"
 effort, with some loss of functionality.
 .
 There are good reasons not to.  libgdal is very capable, but
 not optimum for dynamic GUI based systems like ours.  Its
 great for generating static data from S57 cells.
 .
 I tweaked some of the code to compile on Windows, eliminate
 redundancy, reduce memory footprint, fix some obvious bugs
 present in the version I started with, and add call backs to
 support Progress Dialogs on SENC creation. In theory, these
 fixes should go upstream to GDAL.  In practice, though.....
 .
 IMHO, this kind of improvement for a specific application
 should not block debian repo inclusion.  Otherwise we wear a
 ball and chain, and innovation is stifled.
 .
 Thanks Dave"

Comment: wrt code duplication,
 plugins/demo_pi_sample's copy is just for illustrative purposes.
 see http://opencpn.org/ocpn/flyspray/index.php?do=details&task_id=725
 .
 wrt being an embedded library,
 It does not exist in elsewhere in Debian; the code here has been
 specifically tailored/reworked by the OpenCPN lead author and is
 maintained within the OpenCPN source tree.
