  <p>Welcome!<br>
<br>
Getting started using OpenCPN consists of 3 basic steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#Installing%20OpenCPN">Installing OpenCPN </a></li>
    <li><a href="#Installing%20Charts">Installing Charts </a>to be read by OpenCPN</li>
    <li>*(Optional) <a href="#Setting%20Up%20GPS">Setting Up GPS</a> to "talk" to your computer and OpenCPN</li>
</ol>
Completing these 3 steps will get you started and allow you to check out
 the program.  Later, after exploring the program, you may want to read 
through the <a href="#Basic%20Features">Basic Features </a>and <a href="#Advanced%20Features">Advanced Features </a>sections
 to really get a good grasp of what the program offers.  If you still 
have questions or would just like to get in touch with other OpenCPN 
users, there is also a fairly large community behind OpenCPN. You can 
find us in this Cruiser's <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/">forum.</a><br>  <div id="node-11" class="section-3">

<ul>
    <li>Download the installation package for Windows from <a href="http://opencpn.org/download">opencpn.org/download</a>.</li>
    <li>Use the stable release for navigation en route, or if you just started using OpenCPN.</li>
    <li>Exit all other programs, including your anti virus program - 
known to create problems in some cases. Unplug your network cable, to be
 on the safe side.</li>
    <li>Run the downloaded installer. Re-start your anti-virus. Re-connect the network</li>
    <li>If upgrading from a previous version of OpenCPN, there is no 
need to un-install the old version. Simply install the new version and 
it will upgrade OpenCPN, saving all your existing configuration and 
preferences.</li>
    <li>If this is a new installation, click on the Toolbox icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absMiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.</li>
    <li>If your installation goes well, but OpenCPN don't start as expected, try to download and install <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en">these runtime components</a>.</li>

<ul>
    <li>If you are installing OpenCPN for the first time on a computer 
with Ubuntu, or any other Linux flavor, you have to go through a few 
steps to make sure that all dependencies are met. Ubuntu uses "deb" 
packages and Fedora uses the "rpm" packages.</li>
    <li>On Ubuntu, start "System-&gt;Administration-&gt;Synaptic". In 
Synaptic  go to "Settings-&gt;Repositories" and tick the box 
"Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)". Close Synaptic.</li>
    <li>Download the correct .deb or .rpm from <a href="http://opencpn.org/download">opencpn.org/download</a>.</li>
    <li>Use the stable release for navigation en route, or if you just started using OpenCPN.</li>
    <li>Click on the downloaded package. An installation manager will 
guide you on most Linux distributions. All dependencies should 
automatically be installed. If you have problems with dependencies, run 
the recommended command line in the next paragraph.</li>
    <li>sudo gdebi<span> </span>&lt;downloaded_opencpn_file.deb&gt;. The command "gdebi" will automatically install the dependencies for you.</li>
    <li>It is also possible to install the package via dpkg or rpm, on 
the condition that all dependencies are met.To make sure that this is 
the case on Ubuntu, open a terminal window to get a command line, 
(Applications-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Terminal) and copy and paste the 
following line: <em>sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-0  libwxbase2.8-0 wx-common  libglu1-mesa libgl1-mesa-glx zlib1g bzip2 gpsd gpsd-clients</em>. Then proceed with the commands below<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <pre>For Ubuntu: $ sudo dpkg -i &lt;downloaded_file.deb&gt; 
For Fedora: # sudo yum install --nogpgcheck &lt;downloaded_file.rpm&gt;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>The binary will be installed to <strong>/</strong><strong>usr/local/bin/opencpn</strong> and the static data used by the program will be in <strong>/usr/local/share/opencpn  <br>
        </strong></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If this is a new installation, click on the Toolbox icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absMiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="Different versions of OpenCPN">Different versions of OpenCPN</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use a "stable", official release for actual navigation. The 
latest stable release is always available at the top of the download 
page or from Source Forge.</li>
    <li>Beta releases are snapshots of the development process, and may 
contain errors or temporarily be unstable. Show stoppers are normally 
fixed very quickly however. This is where the latest features first are 
seen. Most of the time the beta releases are quite stable and the 
OpenCPN team appreciate it if more experienced users test the releases 
and report back. The place to report bugs and suggest features is <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a>. To reach <a href="http://www.opencpn.org/flyspray/">the Tracker</a> from the OpenCPN Web pages click on the "Tracker" tab at the upper right (above the blue bar).</li>
    <li class="rteleft">To see what version you are using either look in
  ?-&gt;about or at the top of your display. A lot of information is 
also available in the log file. See below.<br>

<h3 id="Location of Important Files. Log and config files."><strong><a name="#"></a>Location of Important Files. Log and config files.<br>
</strong></h3>
<strong> </strong>
<ul>
    <li> It is important to know the location of the <strong>log file</strong> and the configuration file,<strong> opencpn.conf </strong>or<strong> opencpn.ini</strong>,
 on your computer. If you ask questions on the forum, there is a fair 
chance that you will be asked about the content in these files. Once you
 get familiar with OpenCPN, have a look at the files!</li>
    <li>The configuration file is where all data, that needs to be 
persistent between sessions, is stored. In the same directory as these 
files is the SENC directory, where all the processed S57 ENC vector 
files are stored in a local format.                           </li>
    <li>To find the location of the log file go to the ToolBar click on 
"About OpenCPN", the button furthest to the right. Look at the bottom  
of the "About" Tab, highlighted below. The illustration below is from a 
Win7. A quick way to view the logfile is to copy the full file path and 
then paste this into the address field in a web browser.<br>
    <br>
    <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/help.PNG" alt="" height="538" width="516"></li>
    <li>On <strong>Linux</strong> the "opencpn.log" is in your home directory.<br>
    The "opencpn.conf" is in a hidden directory, called "opencpn", also in your home directory. <br>
    For a quick way to view the files you can try these commands.<br>
    $gedit `echo $HOME/opencpn.log`<br>
    $gedit `echo $HOME/.opencpn/opencpn.conf`<br>
    Of course you can swap "gedit" for your favorite editor.</li>
    <li>On <strong>Windows 2000, XP and Vista and Windows 7 </strong>the
 two files, opencpn.log and opencpn.ini are in the same folder. So to 
find the location of opencpn.ini just go to the folder where the log is.
 Note that some folders in the path to the log and ini files may be 
hidden. Change settings to be able to view hidden and system files. .</li>

  <h1 id="Low Power Systems" class="book-heading">Low Power Systems</h1>
  This is an advanced subject that beginners only need to bother with if
 on a system with very low resources and if the system feels very 
sluggish. The background is that OpenCPN quite aggressively uses memory 
to speed up the application, this can backfire in certain situations....<br>
<br>
There is a simple memory management scheme, for use with systems that has limited resources.<br>
Two modes are available, only one of which can be active at any given 
time. The mode must be specified in the "opencpn.conf" file, called 
"opencpn.ini" in Windows.<br>
<br>
1.  Application memory limit target.  Try to limit the total memory used  by OCPN to the specified value, approximately.  <br>
Specify this mode by:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
MEMCacheLimit=xxx<br>
......<br>
Where xxx is memory use target in Mbytes.  Overrides NCacheLimit below.<br>
<br>
2.  Open <a title="View more discussions on Chart" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/chart.html">chart</a> limit.  This is the default mode under Linux, and the default value is 20 open <a title="View more discussions on Charts" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/charts.html">charts</a> at any one time.<br>
<br>
Modify this limit by the following:<br>
......<br>
[Settings]<br>
NCacheLimit=yy<br>
......<br>
Where yy is the maximum number of simultaneously open <a title="View more discussions on Charts" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/charts.html">charts</a>.<br>
<br>
If you do not enter any memory management specification in the config file, the following defaults apply:<br>
<br>
a.  Linux... behavior is the same as previous versions, Open <a title="View more discussions on Chart" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/chart.html">chart</a> limit is 20 <a title="View more discussions on Charts" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/charts.html">charts</a>.<br>
b.  Windows...Application memory limit target is used.  Target limit is 50% of available physical RAM.<br>

</em></div>
<strong>To install charts OpenCPN must be pointed to a directory containing recognized </strong><a href="#Chart%20Formats"><strong>Chart Formats</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Don't point OpenCPN to individual charts. You must specify the directory that contains the charts. Download some charts (see <a href="#Chart%20Sources">Chart Sources</a>)
 and organize them in a fashion that suits you.  You may want to 
consider storing them in a directory where they will not be tampered 
with or moved accidentally.<br>
Open the Toolbox by clicking <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="" height="32" width="32">.  You are sent to the first tab "Settings". Tick the box "Show Chart Outlines". That will help you visualize the loaded charts.<br>
  <br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/outline.png" alt="" height="317" width="600"><br>
<br>
Then click the tab "Charts".<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/charts1.png" alt="" height="697" width="600"><br>
<br>
Under "Available Chart Directories" navigate to your chart-directory. 
Above we have found the Cape Verde charts in the 
/opt/Navigation/Charts/Raster2Bsb directory. When clicking the button 
"Add Selection" the selected chart directory appears in the box "Active 
Chart Directories". The screen-shots are from Linux, but this process 
works similarly on all platforms. All that remains is to click the "Ok" 
button. OpenCPN will then process your selection. You can now start 
using your charts. <br>
<u>Note that in OpenCPN you must add directories (folders) containing charts, not individual charts.</u><br>
<br>
<strong>Start using your charts</strong>.<br>
You can click and drag the chart with your mouse. The scroll wheel zooms
 in and out. Right clicking brings up a menu with useful actions. 
Exactly what the menu contains depends on the circumstances. Read the 
rest of the manual for a full explanation.<br>
<br>
If you are running OpenCPN for the first time you may see a black 
background instead of the charts you installed.  That simply means 
OpenCPN is pointed at a location that is not on any of the charts you 
installed.  Click and drag, or use the arrow keys, to move the 
view-point to the  location of one of your installed charts as descirbed
 under "<strong>A few hints</strong>" below. The first time you start OpenCPN the view will be centred on Georgetown in South Carolina.<br>

<strong>Starting with vector charts?</strong><br>
If you are new to vector charts on OpenCPN follow this quick-start guide:<br>
<br>
1 Go to ToolBox <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings_002.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">-&gt;Vector Charts and copy the settings below for the Display Category.<br>
<br>
<div class="rteleft"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/default.png" alt="" height="336" width="206"></div>
<br>
2 Press this button <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> in the ToolBar to toggle text display.<br>
<br>
These are not the perfect settings, but you will see most of what you expect from a vector chart.<br>
As soon as you have made yourself reasonably comfortable with OpenCPN 
and before using Vector Charts for actual navigation, make sure you 
understand all the settings in the ToolBox-&gt; Vector Chart Tab by 
reading <a href="http://opencpn.org/vector_chart_display">this page.</a><br>
<strong>Loading Vector Charts</strong><br>
When using a vector chart for the first time OpenCPN has to process the 
 data, and transform the information to an internal display format. This
  can take some time, depending on your computer. This internal SENC 
chart is then saved for future use. The created files are quite large, 
but is in a format optimized for quick loading. The SENC files are saved
 in the SENC directory in the same place as the <a href="http://opencpn.org/installing_opencpn">opencpn.conf file -opencpn.ini on windows.</a><br>
You probably do not want to build SENCs for all of your loaded S57 ENCs unless you plan to actually go there....<br>
<strong>Updating Vector Charts</strong><br>
Publishers of Vector Charts, such as NOAA and EAHC issues regular 
updates. OpenCPN updates the created SENCs automatically. The chart 
itself, the basechart, is named "name".000 , the first update is 
"name".001 and so on. As a user you only have to make sure that the 
update files are saved in the same place as the basechart. In the case 
of a new edition of the chart a new "name".000 file is issued. Just 
replace the old file with the new file and OpenCPN will update the SENC 
file.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 Charts</strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/cmgrid1.png" alt="" height="746" width="600"><br>
<br>
CM93-version2 Charts are different from the S57 vector charts and has 
it's own data structure consisting of a number of folders and files. To 
load these charts in OpenCPN just add the top directory to the list of 
"Active Chart Directories"<br>
The CM93 top directory contains a number of (144) subdirectories named from<br>
"00300000" to "04501020", as well as six other files. These sub 
directories each cover a geographical area of 40° x 40° . The first four
 numbers describes the latitude and the last four, the longitude of the 
SW corner of the area covered.<br>
The key to understanding the numbers is to realize that CM93's coordinate system<br>
of the world starts at the South Pole or to be exact at lat -90° long 0° and from there<br>
proceeds North a East with a factor of 3 for each degree of lat and long.<br>
The tile 00300000 hence has the SW corner at lat from -90° + 0030:3 = -80° or 80°S to<br>
and longitude  0°E , and covers the area from 80°S latitude to 40°S and from 0° longitude to 40°E.<br>
Looking at 04501020 it brakes down to lat -90° + 0450:3 = 60° and long 
1020:3 = 340° subtracting 360° results in -20° or 20°W. So we have he SW
 corner at 60°N and 20°W .<br>
One more example, the tle 03900840 has the SW corner at 40°N and 80°W.<br>
<br>
Each of these sub-directories in turn contains directories with the 
individual charts. Ordered in scale from smallest to largest they are 
Z,A,B,C,D,E,F and G. Where Z contains  overview charts and G contains 
harbor plans. Note that, generally, not all of these are present in each
 subdirectory.<br>
<br>
Z covers 40° x 40° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3.000.000 scale<br>
A covers 20° x 20° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:1.000.000 scale<br>
B covers 10° x 10° deg area and OpenCPN typically uses 1:200.000 scale<br>
down to<br>
..<br>
G covers 20' x 20' and OpenCPN typically uses 1:3500 scale.<br>
The individual chart tiles in these directories have the same logic in the naming scheme as described above.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>A few hints. </strong>
<ul>
    <li>If all is just black, with maybe some blue lines, you are 
viewing the background world vector shoreline chart. You must move to 
the geographical position of the charts you just loaded. As you come 
close you will see the outlines of your loaded charts, in red for raster
 charts and in green for S57 vector charts. Click in the rectangle 
created by the outlines, to activate, and view the chart.</li>
    <li>If you ticked the "Show Chart Outlines" box under the "Settings"
 tab the loaded charts will be outlined in red for raster and green for 
vector charts. In CM93 the charts will be outlined in purple. The 
smallest scale charts in CM93, the Z scale and A scale charts, will not 
be outlined. Neither will all available charts be visible as outlines at
 the same time. The reason for this is computing speed and clarity. 
Generally the next level or two of larger scale charts are shown. When 
large scale plans are available directly from A scale charts, with no 
intermediate charts, the outline of the larger scale charts will be 
visible from a zoom level between 1.5 and 2.0. Generally in areas where 
only A or Z scale charts are available, expect potentially dangerous 
omissions. <strong>Warning</strong>, do not use CM93 small scale charts alone for navigation without referring to other sources.</li>
    <li>Be aware that it is possible to "Over-zoom" charts in OpenCPN. A
 warning will appear on the display. Please respect that warning. It is 
recommended to not zoom more than a factor 2, for safe navigation. The 
actual zoom-factor appears in the lower right-hand corner of the 
display.</li>
    <li>It is safe and reasonably efficient to put all your charts <strong>except </strong>the
 CM93 database in one large directory, and set that directory in 
Toolbox-&gt;Charts. The CM93 database contains its own file and 
directory structure. The top-level directory only, of this database 
should be loaded, as described above, into OpenCPN.<br>
    If you do a lot of chart downloads, updates, etc., then it will be 
faster to break the charts folder into smaller groups, and specify them 
individually in the Toolbox-&gt;Charts dialog.</li>
    <li>The option "<strong>Force Full Database Rebuild</strong>" is 
mainly aimed at users converting or correcting existing charts, in a 
situation where minor changes are made to the geo-referencing or outline
 of the chart, or other attributes in the kap file header section.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN,  supports  <strong>Mercator Charts, Transverse Mercator Charts, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Charts and Polyconical Charts</strong>
 (used in parts of US and Canada). Charts using other projections will 
be displayed as if they were Mercator charts, but they will not be used 
for quilting.  Most charts are using one of the "Mercator" projections, 
so this limitation is not too bad.<br>
    Other projections, such as <strong>Gnomonic</strong>, are mainly 
used in older, larger scale BA charts, for smaller areas, for example 
harbor plans, in scales larger than 1:50,000. <br>
    The errors introduced in OpenCPN by treating these charts as Mercator are generally small, but <strong>be aware of this limitation</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>A Linux/Unix Note</strong><br>
These operating systems have a <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html">problem</a>
 handling chart names containing spaces and non ASCII characters. A 
typical example is Swedish chart names. To sort this out use the utility
 program <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/detox">"detox</a>". Detox changes the file names so space becomes "_"; "(" and ")" become "-"; and "å","ä" and "ö" become "a","a" and "o", etc.<br>
<br>
To see what "detox" suggests to do, try a dry run first, like this:<br>
<em>detox -n File_with_swedish_charts &gt; outfile</em><br>

  <h1 id="Chart Formats" class="book-heading">Chart Formats</h1>
  <h3 id="OpenCPN supported chart formats:">OpenCPN supported chart formats:</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>BSB Versions 1, 2 and 3, with chart files ending with ".kap".</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>BSB Version 4 </strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".cap"</strong>, works with a non free plugin, for Windows only. <a href="http://opencpn.org/downloadplugins">See the Plugins Download Page.</a><br>
<br>
<strong>NOS/GEO Version 1</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".nos" and ".geo".</strong> (Subsequent versions are probably supported but need to be tested. However, this format is obsolete for new charts.)<br>
<br>
<strong>NV Verlag</strong><strong>'s charts, with chart files ending with ".eap"</strong>, are supported through  a non free plugin, for Windows only.</p>
<p><strong>CM93 Version 2.</strong><br>
(C-map Version 3, and later, is in a preprocessed proprietary SENC format  and is not supported.)</p>
<p><strong>S57/S52 (ENC)</strong><strong>, with chart files ending with ".000". </strong><br>
OpenCPNs internal<strong> </strong>SENC files has a ".S57" file extension.<br>
<br>
If a chart is said to be a S57 Vector chart, and has a different file 
ending, it is likely to be a SENC file, a processed version of a ".000" 
chart file, in a proprietary, platform specific format, that OpenCPN 
can't handle. <br>
 </p>
<h3 id="Formats, that with some effort, can be used.">Formats, that with some effort, can be used.</h3>
<p>Generally chart pictures in <strong>gif, jpeg, pdf, png, tif, bmp </strong>and other formats can be used, when properly geo-referenced, to generate<strong> KAP</strong> file (BSB / RNC) that OpenCPN can display. For the details about this process see the <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/charts-31346.html">chart thread</a> in the forum.  Also, make sure to browse around the forum as there are a handful of other interesting chart related threads.</p>
<p><strong>WCI</strong> charts generated with <a href="http://www.sping.com/seaclear/">SeaClear and MapCal </a>can
 also be transformed to BSB charts and used by OpenCPN. The key is to 
open a WCI chart in MapCal and convert it to a BMP picture, and then 
transform this picture to a tiff file, using for example ImageMagic. 
More about using MapCal, a part of SeaClear, for chart conversions, is <a href="http://opencpn.org/chart_conversion_linux">available here.</a><br>
<br>
<b>OziExplorer</b><b><i> </i></b>charts consisting of picture in one of the standard formats, together with a georeferencing "<strong>.map</strong>" file, can be converted to a bsb kapfile. A Ruby script for this conversion is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/map2kap_0.1.11.rb_.zip"><strong>here</strong></a>.
  Ozi charts of the ozfx2 or ozfx3 format can not be converted with this
 tool. These Ozi formats are not documented and proprietary, and cannot 
be displayed in OpenCPN.</p>
<p> Before Maptech started to produce BSB charts the <strong>HDR</strong> format was used in the late eighties to mid nineties. These charts consists of many picture tiles in <strong>pcx </strong>format,
 more than 100 tiles is not unusual. The tiles can be merged to one 
picture and then used as any other picture to make an OpenCPN compatible
 chart. For details on this process see the<a href="#Chart%20Conversion%20Manual"> Chart Conversion Manual</a>  and <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/open-chart-standard-32731-4.html#post381315">this post</a> and the following posts in the forum. A script for merging the pcx tiles to one picture is available <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here.</a></p>
<p> The HDR format is from an era when computer-memory and processing 
power were less powerful than today, as a consequence these charts are 
not of the same quality as more modern charts. Furthermore, most of 
these charts are not using WGS84 as reference datum. These charts should
 not be the first choice, but can be useful if nothing else is 
available.</p>
<h3 id="Other formats that are not supported.">Other formats that are <em>not</em> supported.</h3>
<br>
<strong>S63 Encrypted ENC </strong>is not supported. This is the format 
for the majority of newly produced vector charts from many national 
hydrographic offices. S63 charts are exactly the same as S57 except the 
they are encrypted to keep them from being illegally distributed.<br>
<p>The Hydrographic Chart Raster Format, <strong>HCRF</strong>, used by 
the United Kingdom Hydrographic Offices' ARCS (Admiralty Raster Chart 
Service), Australian Hydrographic Services' Seafarer products and the NZ<em>Mariner</em>, New Zealands Official charts, are not supported.  This is also due to proprietary encryption algorithms and copyright issues.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mapmedia</strong>'s, <strong>Navionics</strong> and various other chart formats are not supported, for the same reasons as for the other proprietary charts.<br>

The motivation for releasing these charts is well worth reading.
    <p><cite>Realizing that official and high quality small scale ENCs 
conforming with the established IHO standard were not available for the 
SCS, the EAHC MSs decided to cooperate closely and resolve the situation
 so that mariners could use most up-to-date chart information for voyage
 planning and enhancing safety of navigation, rather than resorted to 
some commercially developed electronic products which were either 
prepared in proprietary formats, or containing unofficial data with very
 infrequent updating... It was the view that if the SCS ENC could be 
freely and widely available to mariners, it would further enhance the 
safety of navigation in the region. This in turn could reduce the 
chances of environmental damage from grounding and oil pollution, which 
have tremendous cost impact. The EAHC decided to provide the SCS ENC to 
users free of charge.</cite></p>

<h3 id="Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7">Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista/7</h3>
<br>
Note that the extensive use of the cheap gps mouse BU-353 as an example 
below, should only be seen as an illustration, not a recommendation. As a
 matter of fact, many users have problems when using BU-353 on Windows 
7, so this combination is not recommended for now.<br>
<br>
<p>To use OpenCPN with a GPS, a GPS receiver is needed.</p>
<p>There are a variety of possible choices for a GPS receiver:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A computer, such as a Sony Vaio P has a built in GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A NMEA Expander to amplify a nmea stream to multiple listeners</li>
    <li>A handheld GPS receiver</li>
    <li>A dedicated GPS receiver</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of this section describes using OpenCPN with a 
dedicated GPS receiver, however, the instructions for a dedicated 
receiver will be similar for any serial/USB connected NMEA data stream.</p>
<h4 id="A Dedicated GPS Receiver">A Dedicated GPS Receiver</h4>
<p>There are several companies making dedicated GPS receivers. The 
Supplementary Hardware section for GPS devices lists several 
manufacturers.</p>
<p>NMEA has traditionally been implemented as a serial protocol and 
therefore, even if a USB connection is used, there needs to be a USB to 
Serial Port conversion. The specific driver for the each GPS receiver 
will handle this conversion.<br>
 </p>
<h4 id="Configuring BU-353">Configuring BU-353</h4>
<p> It is not necessary to use the installation disk to setup the 
BU-353. Following the steps listed below will result in the latest 
driver being installed.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download the latest driver from Prolific - <a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31" title="http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31">http://www.prolific.com.tw/Eng/downloads.asp?ID=31</a></li>
    <li>Unzip and install the driver</li>
    <li>Plug in the BU-353.</li>
    <li>Start -&gt; (Right Click) My Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Hardware -&gt;Device Manager <br>
    or Start-&gt;Run devmgmt.msc</li>
    <li>Expand Ports</li>
    <li>Look for the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port” and note the com port number (e.g., COM4) <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/DeviceManager-1.jpg" alt="" height="445" width="299"></li>
    <li>Right click on the “Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port”. Choose Driver</li>
    <li>Select 4800 bits per second, 8 data bits, None parity, 1 stop bit, and None for Flow Control <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/Prolific.jpg" alt="" height="450" width="410"></li>
    <li>Start OpenCPN</li>
    <li>Click on the ToolBox Icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absmiddle"></li>
    <li>Select GPS</li>
    <li>Under NMEA Data Source select the Com port noted in #6</li>
    <li>Choose OK</li>
    <li>Select Auto Follow to center the map over your GPS location</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>
<p>There is a small LED located on the BU-353. If the LED is off there is no power being received. Check the connection.</p>
<p>If the LED is solid it indicates the BU-353 is searching for a GPS signal. Try moving the GPS receiver to a clear location.</p>
<p>If the LED is flashing it indicates the BU-353 has a position fix and is transmitting data.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Try viewing the NMEA data stream in OpenCPN. Choose ToolBox-&gt;GPS-&gt;click Show GPS/NMEA Data Stream Window</li>
    <li>Alternatively, a diagnostic program is included on the 
installation CD called GPSInfo.exe. Launch this program to install the 
diagnostic utility.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it appears that the NMEA data stream is being received, the most 
likely issue is that OpenCPN is not centered over your location. Click 
AutoFollow to center the map at your GPS location.</p>
<h4 id="Known Issues">Known Issues</h4>
<p>If you change the USB port for the GPS receiver Prolific will 
reassign the COM port number. This will require repeating steps 4-12 
above.</p>
<p>On some computer / GPS receiver combinations when the computer 
resumes from Stand By the GPS receiver will no longer transmit its NMEA 
data stream, and only garbage instead of ASCII characters will be 
visible in the NMEA Data Stream Window. The red indicator led will not 
work.<br>
<br>
To change back to NMEA mode search for and download SIRFDemo.exe.<br>
Unpack and start. Set correct Baud rate and and com port as above.<br>
Click connect to data source button. Action -&gt; Switch to NMEA protocol, then exit.<br>
There are many more settings available in SIRFDemo.exe</p>
<p>An alternative workaround for this issue is provided by using a COM port splitter such as XPort <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html" title="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html</a></p>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://curioustech.home.insightbb.com/xport.html">XPort</a>.</li>
    <li>Unzip it to a folder of your choice</li>
    <li>Double Click XPort.exe</li>
    <li>Set the Baud Rate to 4800</li>
    <li>Under Enable Ports add an entry for COM10</li>
    <li>Click “Find GPS”. The port returned should match the port identified in Step #6 in the Configuring BU-353 Section</li>
    <li>Select Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port in the check box section</li>
    <li>Return to OpenCPN</li>
    <li>Click on the ToolBox Icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absmiddle"></li>
    <li>Select GPS</li>
</ol>
Under NMEA Data Source change the Com port to COM10

<h3 id="Linux">Linux</h3>
<p>Two methods are available, direct connection or through gpsd.<br>
We start with gpsd.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the gpsd and gpsd-clients packages<br>
    <ul>                  $ sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Go to Toolbox--&gt;GPS and select "Network GPSD" as your  
"NMEA Data Source", unless you have a gpsd version in the 2.9.x series( 
 Ubuntu 10.04  and other new distros). In this case choose   
Toolbox--&gt;GPS --&gt; "NMEA Data Source" --&gt;"Network LIBGPS". </li>
        <li>On Ubuntu 9.10 and later, that is really all you have to do. When you plug in your gps this will trigger gpsd to start.</li>
        <li>"xgps" is client that comes with the gpsd-clients package, and is useful for testing that the gps and gpsd is working properly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Direct connection.</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Make sure that gpsd isn't running then connect your gps and start OpenCPN.</li>
        <li>In the Toolbox--&gt;GPS --&gt; "NMEA Data Source" the  port 
where you plugged in your gps will come up. If you plugged in BU  353 
this will probably be /dev/ttyUSB0.</li>
        <li>Choose 4800 baud, unless you know that the gps is set to something else.</li>
        <li>The gps should now work....if not, check the NMEA data  
stream window. If only binary garbage is visible, the gps has to be  
reset to NMEA mode, see more about this above in windows section.</li>
        <li>To do this in Linux for BU 353 as well as many other  
gps:es, make sure that gpsd is running  and that the package  
"gpsd-clients" is installed.</li>
        <li>The command $gpsctl -n   wil put the GPS into NMEA mode.</li>
        <li>If gpsd isn't running  use $ gpsctl -f -n  /dev/ttyUSB0</li>
        <li>More information is as always available through "man gpsctl" Close down OpenCPN before running gpsctl.<br>
                   <br>
        None of this is normally noticed when using gpsd, as this program reads both NMEA and SIRF binary sentences.</li>
        <li><strong>More Linux hints</strong></li>
        <li>Check that you, as a user, belongs to the group  "dialout". 
To see which groups you belong to, run the command "groups".  Not all 
Linux distributions add the user to this group by default.</li>
        <li>Check if gpsd is working: <br>
        $ ps aux | grep gpsd<br>
        nobody   12338  0.3  0.1   4124  1448 ?        S&lt;s  18:31   0:00 gpsd -F /var/run/gpsd.sock<br>
        you    12356  0.0  0.0   3036   800 pts/3    S+   18:32   0:00 grep --color=tty -d skip gpsd <br>
        This or similar responses indicate that gpsd is running. If  you
 only have something like the second line, ....it is not running.</li>
        <li> Run the command "$udev monitor" to see exactly, and instantly what is going on when you plugin your gps.</li>
        <li>Run the command "$ls -lrtd /dev/*|tail -10", and see the  10
 latest created device files. Run this just after plugin in your gps  to
 see which device was created. <br>
         </li>
        <li>Determine which device your GPS is on your linux system  by 
checking the startup.  Look for a line that says something about  GPS

            Or even better, after connecting a gps mouse, BU-353, we look for a dmesg by running this command.<br>
            <pre>$ dmesg | grep tty
and get this response back.

</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Add a script to start gpsd, if this is not done by your  
distribution.  I saved mine as startgps and set the executable  
attribute.  Edit line 3 to match your device, ie /dev/ttyUSB0<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <pre>#!/bin/sh
 sudo killall gpsd
 sudo gpsd -n -D 2 /dev/ttyUSB0
 </pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Run the script:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <pre>$ ./startgps</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    If this is a new installation, click on the Toolbox icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="Toolbox Settings" align="absmiddle"> and configure your GPS source, chart directories, and other settings.

    <br>
    If you have a bluetooth GPS  you will need to first configure it  
through the standard Ubuntu Bluetooth "set up new device " proceedure. 
Once you have done that you will need to find what the address of the 
GPS is. To do that you run this command:<br>
    <br>
    sudo hcitool scan<br>
    <br>
    it will then start looking for the Bluetooth GPS and hopefully find your GPS. You should see something similar to:<br>
    <br>
    Scanning ...<br>
        00:1C:88:10:D3:4D    iBT-GPS<br>
    <br>
    In this case i have a IBT-GPS at address     00:1C:88:10:D3:4D   (Your GPS address will be different)<br>
    <br>
    Next we have to bind the GPS address to a "virtual" device OpenCPN 
understands in this case rfcomm0. We do this with the following command:<br>
    <br>
    sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 00:1C:88:10:D3:4D        Note put your GPS address in this line<br>
    <br>
    You should not have to run these commands  each time your linux is restarted as it will remeber your GPS address.<br>
    <br>
    Now all you need to do is go into OpenCPN Toolbox and select GPS. 
Now in the NMEA Data Source options select from the pulldown menu: 
"/dev/rfcomm0".<br>
    <br>
    Thats it - you should now have a Bluetooth GPS Connected.<br>
    <br>
    <h3 id="Mac OSX">Mac OSX</h3>
    <br>
    Attaching a GPS device to a Mac is done via one of the USB ports. 
Whether using a device with its own USB lead or via a serial-USB adapter
 lead or an NMEA multiplexer with USB port, the appropriate OS X driver 
needs to be installed. Nearly all hardware uses one of just two chip 
makes: those from FTDI or Prolific. Both those companies make OS X 
drivers available on their web sites, but manufacturers of GPS devices 
usually package the driver with device.<br>
    <br>
    When the driver is installed and the device connected, start 
OpenCPN, select the Toolbox and click the GPS tab. Open the "NMEA Data 
Source" menu &amp; select the the device from the list. It is not always
 obvious which is the correct one, but in general the device will have a
 name starting: "/dev/cu." or "/dev/tty.". Some manufacturers make it 
obvious, like "/dev/cu.MiniPlex-99000125", but others may be more 
generic, like: "/dev/cu.usbserial". Set the "NMEA Baud Rate" to 4800 and
 click "OK". If the correct selection has been made, you should see the 
GPS status icon change from red to green.<br>

  <p>The Toolbar is floating and can be placed anywhere on the screen, vertical or horizontal.<br>
Note the "grabber" symbol at the far right side of the toolbar.  Use 
this handle to drag the toolbar wherever you want it. The default 
position is horizontal and docked top left.<br>
It "snaps" to the edges.  Right click on the grabber, and the toolbar  
shifts to vertical format.  On Windows (at least), the toolbar dims down
  transparently until you roll over it.<br>

If you zoom in enough there will appear a warning "OverZoom" in the 
upper left part of the chart area. This means that you have zoomed in 
way to far, and is using the chart<br>
at a scale that was never intended, and that is not supported by the 
original survey. No new information will be seen, and the situation is 
potentially dangerous<br>
as it could give the impression of  increased distance between dangers.<br>
On a raster-chart pixelation  will be seen, but on a vector chart it is not so<br>
obvious when you have over zoomed. This is where the warning is useful.<br>
Your first action when the warning appears should be to zoom out at least one snap.<br>

  <h1 id="Chart Quilting" class="book-heading">Chart Quilting</h1>
  Chart quilting is a way to display parts of several charts together on the screen, redrawn to the same scale.<br>
<br>
<strong>Limitation</strong><br>
Mercator charts and Transverse Mercator charts are quilted separately 
and don't mix. The transition from one form of quilting to the other is 
seamless. Black areas can appear in Tmerc quilt in areas where there is 
no chart cover.<br>
<br>
<strong>Quick Start</strong><br>
Go to ToolBox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Enable Chart Quilting. Tick he box. 
Once quilting is on in the Toolbox, F9 becomes a toggle switch to 
temporarily get into single mode display. Zooming in, automatically 
brings up larger scale charts, if available. Panning reveals a 
continuous quilt of the available charts. If you started with a raster 
chart, only raster-charts, and perhaps CM93, will be in the quilt. The 
same logic applies to S57 Vector Charts (ENCS). Make sure you are 
familiar with the <a href="#Status%20Bar">Status Bar</a> as this will 
help you interpret all available information. The quilt, like a single 
chart can be displayed North Up or Course Up read more:  <a href="#Auto%20Follow%20and%20Display%20Orientation">Auto Follow and Display Orientation</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>More details</strong><br>
What is the use of this feature? <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/quilt3.png" alt="" height="616" width="800"><br>
<br>
<em>In single chart mode, getting near the edge of the chart there is no  information outside the chart.</em><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/quilt4.png" alt="" height="616" width="800"><br>
<h3 id=""> </h3>
<p><em>The situation changes dramatically when quilting mode is 
activated. The  amount of  relevant information on the screen increases.</em></p>
<h3 id="Displaying charts"><br>
Displaying charts</h3>
OpenCPN has two modes of displaying charts, single chart mode and quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<strong>To activate</strong> <strong>chart quilting </strong>go to 
Toolbox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Chart Display Options  and tick the box 
"Enable Chart Quilting",  tick the box "Show Chart Outlines" at the same
 time as this will help you see which chart mode is active. For CM93 the
 outline of individual charts can bee seen only if quilting is disabled.<br>
<br>
<strong>Full Screen Quilting</strong>. Toolbox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Disable Fullscreen Quilting. <font color="#000000"><span>By
 default all visible charts of an  appropriate scale are used in the 
quilt. With this box checked only  charts that overlap the center of the
 screen are used in the quilt.  Checking this box is easier on the 
system and may give a performance  boost in certain circumstances.</span></font><br>
<br>
<strong>Is Chart quilting on?</strong><br>
When hovering with the mouse pointer over a inactive chart button in 
single chart mode, a thumbnail of the chart is displayed in the upper 
left corner of the screen. At the same time an information box pops up 
above the button with details about the chart.  This changes with 
quilting as the thumbnail is replaced with a high-lightning of the 
charts part in the quilt with a transparent reddish color. <br>
<br>
The exception to the last rule is CM93 charts. When an area is only 
covered by CM93 charts, indicated by a long yellow chart button in the 
status bar, and in quilting mode, no info-box is displayed and no 
reddish highlighting is taking place. When CM93 quilting is off, the 
individual cells are outlined in magenta.<br>
<br>
More than one chart can be displayed and active at the same time, on the
 picture above, for example there are three pale blue buttons, as there 
are three raster-charts in this quilt. In single mode only one chart 
button is highlighted at a time.<br>
<br>
Depth units that is normally shown in the upper right corner of the 
display, if activated in the toolbox, is only displayed in quilting mode
 if all participating charts  uses the same unit.<br>
Zoom level, normally displayed on the far right on the Status bar, is not present in quilting.<br>
<br>
Many of these features are illustrated in this screen-dump.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/quilt5.png" alt="" height="616" width="800"><br>

The mouse pointer is over the middle raster chart and the chart 
information box is shown, together with the red highlighting of the 
chart on the screen.<br>
No depth unit is shown in the quilt as the left chart is in Feet and the
 right in Fathoms an parts thereof. Notice the lack of zoom level in the
 status bar, a quilt , by definition, consists of several different zoom
 levels.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Which charts are quilted?</strong><br>
There are several rules built into OpenCPN governing exactly how different charts reacts to the quilting mode.<br>
<strong>Raster charts</strong> and <strong>Vector charts </strong>are 
quilted separately and don't mix together. You can quilt either raster 
charts or vector charts, but not both at the same time. <br>
The exception to this rule is that CM93 ver2 charts, if available, are 
shown if no other Mercator chart cover exists for a displayed area, for 
both raster- and vector- chart quilting.<br>
Transverse Mercator Charts, which are all raster charts, are strictly 
quilted on their own. In this case, black areas can occur where there is
 no coverage.<br>
Polyconic Charts, which are all raster charts as well, are also strictly
  quilted on their own. In this case, black areas can occur where  there
 is no coverage.<br>
<br>
<strong>CM93 ver2</strong> charts can be quilted separately.<br>
<br>
<strong>Mercator Charts</strong> are always quilted in quilting mode but don't quilt together with Transverse Mercator charts or Polyconic charts.<br>
<strong>Polyconic Charts</strong>, are quilted separately, and don't mix with Mercator or Transverse Mercator Charts<br>
<strong>Skewed Charts</strong> are allowed in the quilt as long as they don't deviate more than 5 degrees<br>
from North Up.<br>
<strong>Transverse Mercator Charts  </strong>are quilted separately from Mercator- and Polyconic- Charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>User control</strong>.<br>
Users can control if an individual chart, is allowed in the quilt or 
not. Right clicking on any chart in a quilt and clicking "Remove this 
chart from quilt" on the pop up menu, removes the chart from the quilt. 
The chart button in the Status bar changes to <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/not_participate.png" alt="" height="20" width="60">.<br>
To activate the chart again right click this button an then click "Ad this chart to quilt"<br>

<strong>Known issues with some NOAA ENC:s </strong><br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/st-croix_gray2.png" alt="" height="614" width="468"><br>
<br>
Some NOAA ENC:s are produced with "holes" in. OpenCPNs present quilt 
handling is not geared to handle this, and gray areas can under some 
circumstances be visible. The picture above is from S:t Croix in the 
Caribbean. Gray areas of three different kinds are visible.<br>
<br>
The Northern gray rectangle is an "unsurveyed" area, where, strangely 
enough, a smaller scale chart is available with a "survey". Use the 
ChartBar to switch to the smaller scale chart if necessary. Note the 
black frame.<br>
<br>
The Middle two gray rectangles are "holes" in a small scale chart, where
 larger scale charts exists. Once again use the chart bar. Tick  
Toolbox-&gt;Etc "Preserve scale when changing charts" to keep the same 
scale when switching to larger scale charts. Note that the areas are 
framed in green, indicating that larger scale charts are available.<br>
<br>
The Southern gray rectangle is a "hole" with no information available at
 all, and no other ENC charts are available. Note that there is no frame
 at all around this area.<br>

<div id="node-37" class="section-3">
  <h1 id="Status Bar" class="book-heading">Status Bar</h1>
  <p>On the bottom is the Status Bar(s). Activated from 'Tool Box-Show Status Bar'.</p>
<p>The top line, 'Chart Selection Bar', has the following description.<br>
It shows all the available chart for the present view represented by one
 segment for each chart. The order between the segments represents the 
scale of the charts. Largest scale to the left, smallest to the right. 
If CM93 is available, it is always furthest to the right. <br>
The segmented color bars in the Status Bar represent:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blue for Raster</li>
    <li>Green For ENC's</li>
    <li>Brown/Yellow for CM93 charts</li>
    <li>The current chart displays as a lighter shade of its color, or 
if quilting is active, the charts currently making up the quilt are 
displayed in lighter shade.</li>
    <li>The Chart bar below consisting of 12 segments shows a quilt of 
two active charts. Five charts in the quilt are hidden, due to small 
scale. CM93 is in it's place, to the right. Four charts of larger scale 
than the present view are available. The largest scale chart is a 
Transverse Mercator chart.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/seg.png" alt="" height="97" width="700"></p>
<h3 id="Limitation">Limitation</h3>
The Chart Bar handles a maximum of 100 charts. The largest scale charts 
will be dropped first if more than 100 chart are available on a 
position. It is unlikely that this will be much of a limitation, but the
 possibility certainly exists if a lot of info charts, pilot charts and 
weather charts etc, are loaded. The syntom will be that large scale 
charts becomes impossible to display.<br>
<p><br>
When you hover the mouse pointer over the bar, and not in quilting mode, a thumbnail of the chart will appear under the <a href="#Scaling%20Charts">Scaling Charts </a>icons
 and a chart information box will pop up just above the button. If 
quilting is on, instead of a thumbnail, the chart represented by the 
button will be highlighted in a transparent reddish color. By clicking 
on the appropriate bar, or using the appropriate <a href="#Hot%20Keys">Hot Keys</a>,
 you will switch to the chart shown in the thumbnail. This feature is 
especially useful if you wish to view an ENC or a Raster chart of the 
same area.</p>
<p><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/StatusBar.png" alt="" height="35" width="900"></p>
<p>The bottom line starting from the left, has the position of the GPS 
that feeds OpenCPN (your ship or boat). SOG, COG, Cursor (position), 
From Ownship and TrueScale and Zoom Factor are in other boxes. If the 
Zoom Factor is missing on the far right, the chart quilting feature is 
activated.<br>

    The raster chart represented by this button don't participate in the
 quilt because it is hidden by other, larger scale charts. Vector charts
 are represented similar.<br>
<br>
To illustrate a lot of this, here is a screen shot in quilting mode.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/quilt2.png" alt="" height="655" width="850"> <br>
<br>
<em>The screen is a quilt of two Polyconical charts. Hovering the mouse 
pointer over the left chart-button highlights the lager scale chart for 
Manitowoc. Two smaller scale charts that cover the area displayed on the
 screen are included in the quilt, but are invisible as they are covered
 by the larger scale charts. To view these charts, right-click anywhere 
on a chart in the quilt and select "Remove this chart from quilt", one 
of these charts will now be shown in the quilt.<br>
The Brown right most button shows that CM93 version 2, charts are available for the area, but not currently displayed.<br>
The information box shows relevant information about the chart. We can 
see that the chart is  Polyconic, and because of this a warning is 
displayed for poor accuracy. The reason is, that although Polyconic 
charts are allowed to participate in quilting, the result is not totally
 free from errors, however small.</em><br>

    <li>The Auto Follow button useful for two different situations:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>When you have panned the map away from your current location and want to quickly move back to your vessel.</li>
    <li>When underway, this will keep the display on the chart around your vessel, with the boat at the center of the chart.</li>
</ol>

    <li>The display can be oriented two ways, normally it is <strong>North Up</strong> but  <strong>Course Up</strong>
 is an alternative. With Course Up OpenCPN uses COG, course over ground.
 The easiest way to change between these two modes is through the "Right
 Click" menu. One situation where course up might be considered is when 
navigating a river or a canal.</li>
    <li>If an electronic compass is available in the NMEA stream the own
 ship icon will be orientated according to this heading. The difference 
can be seen on the chart if there is a cross current, for example.  The

 changes. To prevent this kind of scenario OpenCPN works like this:<br>
    *If the boat speed is less than 1 kt, then lookahead is disabled.<br>
    *If boat speed is greater than 3 kts, lookahead is enabled.<br>
    *In between 1 and 3 kts, the lookahead "distance" is adjusted smoothly.<br>
    *If  the problems still there when doing more than 3 kts, consider 
using  "ToolBox-&gt;GPS-FilterNMEA Course and Speed data"  to average 
out the "jumpiness".</li>

the Route Manager. A record of all the trackpoint will be listed. Below 
we can see a trackpoint entry every minute, due to the selection above 
of a trackpoint every 60 seconds. Click on either a "Leg" or "To a

  Drop a Man Over Board Marker at your present position by pressing<br>
<strong>* Man Over Board Button</strong> <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/mob_btn.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="32" width="32">  on the ToolBar <br>
or hit the<strong> </strong>Keys<strong> <br>
*Ctrl + Spacebar</strong>. <br>
<br>
A mark, looking like the button is instantly created - the MOB mark.<br>
The MOB mark will be called "MAN OVERBOARD at + time-stamp"<br>
<br>
A temporary route, <strong>from </strong>a point 1 mile ahead on the current COG, and <strong>to </strong>the
 MOB mark is created and activated. On the screen, a course and bearing 
to the MOB mark will be displayed. This temporary triangular mark is 
labeled "1.0 NM along COG".<br>
<br>
If COG, course over ground, is not available, no route is created but 
the MOB position is marked. This can happen if no GPS is connected, if 
the GPS signal is (temporary) unavailable or if the speed is so low that
 the GPS doesn't calculate COG.<br>
<br>
The temporary route can be deleted, through the right-click menu, but no
 action of the user with the mouse or keyboard will move or delete the 
MOB mark, except for opening the Route/Waypoint manager to delete the 
mark, or right click -&gt; Mark/Wpt Properties and select a different 
icon, and then delete the mark (ex mob mark) from the right click menu.<br>
<br>
Multiple MOB marks can be deployed, and multiple temporary routes will 
be created. The active route will always be associated with the last 
dropped MOB mark.<br>
<br>
Be very careful when using this capability in waters with strong tide or current.<br>
The person overboard will <strong>not</strong> be at the position of the
 MOB mark for long. Both Own Boat and the person in the water will move 
with the current, but OpenCPN knows nothing about this.<br>

At a scale of 1:200.000 or larger these isolated Islands and dangers

<br>
<strong>NMEA Data Source:</strong> Set the source for your GPS 
connection. Note that you can write in this field. For example to get 
"Gippy" to work with OpenCPN, this is where you write the path to the 
virtual GPS created by Gippy. Similar, if you know that the GPS is on 
COM3, but this port does not show up in the list, just write "COM3" in 
the field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Details for windows.</strong><br>
Due to performance reason OpenCPN by default only accepts COM ports up 
to 32. If this is not enough, OpenCPN will accept ports up to 42 with 
the following line added to the opencpn.ini configuration file:<br>
<span><span><em>[Settings]<br>
WindowsComPortMax=42</em></span></span><br>
In the tab select  the 'NMEA Data Source' from the choices shown in the 
drop-down box, and  choose the port to which your GPS is connected. If 
you are using a standard serial port, then choose  the proper physical 
port number to match. If, on the other hand, you are  using a USB GPS, 
then you will select the virtual serial port which was  created by your 
GPS device driver. You may need to try several  selections to find the 
correct port.   For XP/Vista: Using the  Device Manager, look for a 
serial port which appears and disappears  dynamically as you plug and 
unplug the USB GPS cable. This is your  virtual GPS serial port. When 
the properly configured GPS is connected,  powered up, and recognized, 
and a show a green <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/gpsGrn.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28"> icon or gps status icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/gps2.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="28" width="28">
 in the right end of the tool-bar.   OpenCPN  automatically configures  
bits, parity, etc. These do not  need to be separately specified.<br>
<br>
<strong>Details for Linux.</strong> Connect directly to one of the 
available physical ports, or use gpsd. For gpsd versions earlier than 
2.9, select "Network GPSD" else select "Network LIBGPS". For Ubuntu 10.4
 and later select "Network LIBGPS".<br>
<br>
<strong>GPSD Data Server:</strong> is normally "localhost", but it's 
possible to have one gpsd server on a local network with many OpenCPN 
clients. In this case, specify the network address of the gpsd server. 
With OpenCPN it's possible to connect even a <strong>Windows</strong> instance, to a gpsd server this way.<br>
<br>
<strong>NMEA Baude Rate:</strong> 4800 is the normal value for many devices, but some newer gps receivers require a different value. Check your documentation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use Garmin</strong> <strong>GRMN/GRMN(Host) mode for Waypoint and Route  uploads</strong>.
 Make sure that  this box is ticked, if you have a Garmin GPS. The 
reason for this is that Garmin units cannot accept route uploads via 
standard NMEA0183.  This is a "design feature" of all Garmin receivers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show GPS/NMEA data stream window:</strong> If you  check this box you will get a window that shows the NMEA data sentences  coming into OpenCPN.<br>
If gpsd is used on Linux, no data will be shown.<br>
For  simple NMEA data stream debugging, add the following to your opencpn.ini  file:Under  [Settings] add a line <br>
<em>DebugNMEA=1500</em><br>
This will provide up  to 1500 debug messages pertaining to NMEA traffic to the opencpn.log <br>
<br>
<strong>Filter NMEA Course and Speed Data:</strong> Providing a rolling 
average of COG/SOG, with configurable sampling period. This feature is 
useful, for example, if you find that course and speed from the gps is 
varying erratically due to the sea state. The Dashboard plugin is not 
affected by this setting  - COG and SOG are updated about once per 
second.<br>
<br>
<strong>Course-Up Mode Display Update Period:</strong> This relates to how often the entire displayed chart is updated.  The ownship and <a href="#AIS">AIS</a> icons are still updated every second. The default value is 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
<strong>Autopilot Output Port:</strong> Connect any NMEA  0183 
compatible autopilot. Select the correct serial port from the list. 
OpenCPN does accept autopilot output on the main GPS input port, using 
the same baud rate, unless it is set to "<span>AIS Port (Shared)"</span>.<br>
If you need the NMEA RMC sentence output on your <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/autopilot.html" class="sk_tag" title="View more discussions on Autopilot">autopilot</a> port, add the following in the opencpn.ini file, called opencpn.conf in Linux:<br>
..........<br>
[Settings]<br>
<a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/autopilot.html" class="sk_tag" title="View more discussions on AutoPilot">AutoPilot</a> NMEA Sentence Out=RMB;RMC<br>
..........<br>
Default is RMB only, and works for most autopilots.<br>
Most users will not need this config entry.<br>

<strong>Show Track Icon.</strong> This is used to enable  <a href="#Ship%20Track">Ship Track</a>s. This is a visible trail behind your own craft.<br>
<br>
<strong><a name="#"></a>Automatic Daily Tracks</strong>.     <br>
Automatic Daily Tracking ensures that the track-points collected 
throughout a single day (midnight to midnight in local zone time) are 
stored and managed as a single (possibly multi-segment) track.<br>
If the Automatic Daily Tracking check-box is selected, the "Toggle 
Tracking" tool will - as before - turn tracking on and off. However, on 
turning it off, the accumulated track will be extended with the previous
 one, if it does not extend into yesterday. Disjoint segments are kept 
separate, time-adjacent segments are merged into a single segment.<br>
Every Midnight the tracking is turned off and on again automatically, to ensure that the track does not span dates.<br>
If Automatic Daily Tracking is selected during the day, when some tracks
 have already been created, only the last one will be merged with future
 daily tracks.<br>
Assuming Automatic Daily Tracking is on, normally during tracking 
periods there will be two tracks visible in the Route Manager: the 
current track (red color track-points on the chart) and the previously 
accumulated track for the day. After toggling tracking off there will be
 just one track for this day.<br>
If the timezone needs to be changed, it is a good idea to close OpenCPN application before..<br>
With the manual capability of splitting and extending, the daily tracks can be easily managed at any time.<br>
Without Automatic Daily Tracking selected, OpenCPN handles tracks as before.<br>
For tracks without explicit names Route Manager displays names 
consisting of starting time-stamp (in UTC). It is highly recommended to 
develop some own habit for assigning names.<br>
<br>
<strong>Place Track-points</strong> at either time or distance interval.
 This affects the size of the data saved to keep the track visible. It 
also affects the "smoothness" of the track.<br>
<br>
<strong>Radar rings:</strong> These show up as red rings centered on  
your gps position, and can be useful in different circumstances, such as
  keeping clear of dangers. The settings are, hopefully, intuitive.<br>
<br>
<strong>Waypoint locking</strong>. Locks waypoints, and prevents accidental moving of them. This box should normally be ticked  when under way.<br>
<br>
<strong>GUI Options</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Enable wheel-zoom-to-cursor</strong>: Normally when clicking on 
 the screen, the display centers on the clicked point. The wheel zooms  
in/out always using the center of the display. With this box ticked,   
the zooming happens at the point of the cursor. This means that as soon 
 as you start to zoom in the cursor stay in the same place on the screen
 and on approximately the same geographical position. The advantage is 
that the zooming in position can be fine tuned just using the cursor. <br>
<br>
<strong>Preserve scale when switching charts:</strong>  Normally when  
switching charts OpenCPN will open the new chart scaled close to it's  
natural scale, the zoom factor stays the same. With this box ticked  
OpenCPN will keep the scale from the last chart, when switching, not  
exactly, but generally of the same magnitude. The zoom-factor will  
increase as you switches to smaller scale charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Play ship bells:</strong> Every half-hour the traditional ship bell will  be heard. <br>
<br>
<strong>Show toolbar in fullscreen mode:</strong> The key F11 toggles fullscreen mode on/off. <br>
<br>
<strong>Enable transparent toolbar:</strong> On Linux it is necessary to
  activate a window manager compositing system, such as Compiz or GNOME 
 Shell, to have a transparent toolbar.<br>
<br>
<strong>Show layers initially</strong>:Layers that are saved in a 
directory called "layers", in the same place that holds your 
opencpn.ini(config) file(Windows) or /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers(Linux),
 are automatically  loaded on start of OpenCPN. Any subdirectories in 
the layers directory,  are also loaded.<br>
To actually display the loaded layers on startup, tick this box. Further
 adjustment to visibility is possible in the Route Managers Layer Tab.<br>

  This Button <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/colscheme.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> has 4 levels corresponding to standard US raster charts built in levels.<br>
These represents the Default level, the Daylight level, the Dawn or Dusk
 level and finally the Night level. Generally there is no difference 
between the Default level and the Daylight level.<br>
<br>
The way this button works differs between different category of charts.<br>
<br>
<strong>S57 Vector Charts and the CM93 ver2 charts.</strong><br>
All charts display the Dawn/Dusk and Night levels. This means that there
 is no change when the button is first pressed, but further pressing 
brings up a Dusk and then a Night palette.<br>
<strong>US Raster Charts</strong><br>
These works the same as the vector-charts.<br>
<strong>Other Raster Charts</strong><br>
Most other raster charts just contains a standard palette, and pressing 
the Button has no effect other than dimming part of OpenCPN, except for 
the chart display.<br>
The Brazilian Raster Charts includes a dusk and night palette, but the colors displayed is not what one would expect.<br>
Charts converted with the help of libbsb and tiff2bsb, only contains one standard color scheme.<br>

  <h1 id="Anchor Watch" class="book-heading">Anchor Watch</h1>
  <h2 id=""> </h2>
<p>Anchor watch can be set on any mark that you have created with 
OpenCPN, except for a mark that belongs to a layer, as long as the boat 
is within 5 cables of this mark. This means that the Anchor watch items,
 on the right click menu, will only be visible if  your boat is within 
0.5 nautical miles of a mark.  A maximum of two marks can have anchor 
watch set at the same time. Get around the restriction with a mark in a 
layer, by creating a new mark nearby. </p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/AW1.png" alt="" height="413" width="400"></p>
This feature can be used in other situations than just anchoring, but 
keeping an eye on your anchor, and making sure it isn't dragging, is the
 main purpose. Below we are using the "Man Overboard" icon to mark the 
anchor, this is just an easy way, and not necessary for the anchor watch
 to work.<br>
<br>
To learn how it works let's make a dry run to a nice trade wind anchorage.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch.png" alt="" height="354" width="400"></div>
<br>
After circling around and exploring the bay, we know where we want to drop our anchor.<br>
At  the chosen spot we drop the anchor, at the same time we click the man overboard icon on OpenCPN to mark the point.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch1.png" alt="" height="361" width="401"></div>
<br>
The wind, ENE at 15 kts let us drift back until we are satisfied with 
our scope. A burst in reverse convinces us that the anchor is set, later
 confirmed by a leisurely snorkeling over the anchor. Time to sort out 
the anchor watch<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch2.png" alt="" height="581" width="343"></div>
<br>
Right click on the man over board mark, choose properties, this brings 
up the "Mark Properties" dialog. We have to change a few things here to 
make it worthwhile setting the anchor watch. "Mark Name" is changed from
 "MAN OVERBOARD" to the watch circle in meters. In our case we have 
changed this to 60. We have 40 m of chain out, our gps antennae on our 
40 footer sits at the pushpit, some minor gps uncertainties and a few 
extra meters for our anchor to dig in, is our reasoning for this. We 
also change the mark icon to something better than the life-buoy.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch3.png" alt="" height="364" width="400"></div>
<br>
We right click on the mark once again, and choose "Set Anchor Watch" from the menu.<br>
, except for a mark that belongs to a layer, See picture above. The 
anchor watch is now active, and an alarm will be set off if the boat for
 some reason exits the circle. To deactivate the anchor watch, right 
click on the mark and select "Clear Anchor Watch".<br>
<br>
To get protection from the wind and a bit of northerly swell, we have 
really anchored to close to the beach. To keep an eye on this potential 
danger we set another mark on the beach.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch4.png" alt="" height="449" width="400"></div>
<br>
This time we set the "Mark Name" to -100, this means that if the boat 
comes within 100 meters of this mark, the alarm is set off.<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchor-watch5.png" alt="" height="360" width="400"></div>
<br>
An hour later, after a heavy squall passed, the wind goes light and 
flukey. The boat drifts towards the beach and the anchor alarm sounds 
and comes up on our computer screen. <br>
The alarm sound is the same as the AIS warning sound and is set in the ToolBox under the AIS tab.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/anchorwatch6.png" alt="" height="362" width="401"></div>
<br>
This is what happens if you activate the anchor watch without changing 
the name, the alarm  is instantly activated. Clear the anchor watch and 
read from the beginning of the page.<br>

  <h1 id="AIS" class="book-heading">AIS</h1>
  <p>For a general introduction to AIS <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Identification_System">Wikipedia</a> is a good place to start.<br>
The screendump below gives you a first feel for how AIS targets are presented and used in OpenCPN.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais_0.png" alt="" height="578" width="750"><br>
<br>
<em>The Lookahead mode is activated here and our own vessel is 
proceeding 352 deg at 13 kts, leaving an activated track behind, and 
projecting a dashed line ahead representing the course. This ends in a 
dot, that represents where we will be in 6 minutes, or 1.3 nautical 
miles ahead. We are meeting a vessel, steaming in the opposite direction
 following the traffic separation. This target also has a line and a dot
 in-front of it representing course and where it will be in 6 
minutes(user configurable). The two blue dots with a red/yellow line 
between them, represents where the vessels will be at CPA - closest 
point of approach, or when the are nearest each other, with present 
courses and speeds.</em><em> The meeting vessel is red, as it is a potential danger to us.</em><br>
<br>
A lot of information about the vessels that transmits AIS signals and are displayed on the chart, is available.<br>
 </p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais11.png" alt="" height="452" width="368"></p>
<p><br>
<em>The cursor is on top of the the meeting vessel on a SW course. As we
 have not yet received full information, this can take a while, we don't
 get the name but an id number, the so called MMSI number, instead. 
Exactly what is shown in the yellow popup is configured in the AIS tabs 
Rollover heading.<br>
<br>
</em></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais2.png" alt="" height="308" width="356"></p>
<p><br>
<em>This vessel is identified by name, and has a green color, as it does not represent any danger to our navigation.<br>

 </p>
<p class="rteleft"><em>If we instead of just hovering the cursor on an 
object, right click, the menu item AIS Target Query brings up the dialog
 above. A lot of relevant information is displayed. TCPA is the time 
until CPA, how long before we are at the closest point to the other 
vessel.</em><br>
<br>
  <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais4.png" alt="" height="578" width="750"><br>
<em>All the bells and whistles are activated! A new target appears 
behind an island on our port bow, OpenCPN sounds an alarm and draws a 
jagged circle around the new target. An AIS alert box with all the 
information about the new target pops up. We can silence the noise but, 
has to acknowledge before the box disappears.<br>

<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais-list.png" alt="" height="250" width="750"><br>
Another way to present the AIS information. The AIS target list is 
available through the right click menu.  Click on a header in a column 
to sort according to this criteria. For example, clicking "Range" sorts 
the targets with the nearest target on top. Click one more time to get 
the target, furthest away on top.<em><br>

<strong>CPA calculation</strong>: Rules for how and when the Closest 
Point of Approach- CPA (when two vessels are nearest each other) is 
calculated. There are three tick boxes, which can be activated with user
 set values.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> If the vessel is far away it is less interesting to 
calculate CPA. In a busy waterway this could cut down on clutter and 
processing speed if a reasonable value is set.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Similar arguments to No 1. This controls when a warning for minimum CPA distance is given.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Similar to No 2 this controls the alarm based on a 
minimum time to CPA. A target is regarded as lost if regular 
transmissions is not received, updating the vessels status.<br>
<br>
<strong>Lost Targets:</strong> Rules for how lost targets should be handled on the display. <br>
<strong>1.</strong> Target is regarded as lost if no transmission are 
received for the number of minutes set here, the target will change on 
the display and have a black bar across.<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais-lost.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="51" width="51"><br>
<strong>2.</strong> The lost target will be removed from the display after the number of minutes set here.<br>
<br>
<strong>Display:</strong> If and how a vessels course and speed should be displayed and if stationary vessels should be on the screen.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> An arrow will be shown in front of the vessel 
representing it's COG (Course Over Ground). The length of this arrow and
 the dot at the end of it represents the calculated position in the 
number of minutes set here. Set easily calculated values. If a vessel 
approaches you doing 15 kts and the time is set to 6 minutes, the dot 
will be 1.5 nautical miles ahead of the vessel.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> A track will be shown behind a target. This helps to judge the target vessels intentions.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/trail.png" alt="" height="213" width="600"><br>
<strong><br>
3.</strong> An anchored or moored target <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ais-moor.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="50" width="50">
  will not be displayed if the speed is less than the value set here. 
This "avigational Staus" is set by the ships and may not be correct.<br>
<br>
<strong>Rollover:</strong> Tick the boxes for the kind of information 
shown when hovering with the cursor over a target. This is what you get 
with all the settings  ticked.</p>

<p class="rteleft"><br>
<strong>CPA/TCPA Alerts:</strong> When an alert is triggered, a jagged 
circle in red is drawn around the target that set off the alarm. 
Additional events can be set here, drawing more attention to the alarm. 
For practical navigation, make sure your alarm sound is set.<br>
<strong>1.</strong> Shows an alert dialog on the screen with target information when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Sounds an alarm when an alarm is triggered.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Don't show alarms for anchored and moored targets.<br>
<br>
<strong>Select Alert Sound.</strong> Select an alarm that suits you. 
This alarm will also be used if an anchor watch is set. Due to copyright
 issues, only a few sound files are included. Users can add their own 
generic ".wav" sound files. The location for these files are  
"/usr/local/share/opencpn/sounds/" on Linux and typically C:\Program 
Files\OpenCPN\sounds on Windows XP.<br>
<strong>Test Alert Sound.</strong> Test the selected sound and make sure this important feature is working<br>
<br>
<strong>Enable Target Alert Acknowledge timeout</strong>. Once a target alert is acknowledged, wait the set number of minutes before the alert comes up again (if still applicable).</p>
<p class="rteleft">.</p>
<h3 id="When exactly is an alarm activated?"><br>
<strong>When exactly is an alarm activated?</strong></h3>
<p class="rteleft">An alert is set off if your boat is approaching the 
CPA, the blue dot on  the extension of the course line, and the 
previously discussed set of  conditions are met. Once the distance to 
the CPA increases, this happens  when the involved vessels has passed 
each other, the alarm stops,  even if the other conditions still apply. </p>

<h3 id="Marks...">Marks...</h3>
<br>
are the basic points that is used for many things, such as creating 
routes, marking fishing spots, good anchorages or anything of interest.<br>
<br>
OpenCPN comes with a handful of different icons that can be assigned to a
 mark. Right click or use the Route Manager and activate the properties 
dialog. The Mark Icon window in the dialog shows the available icons.  <br>
<br>
A user can install his or her own icons to use with marks and "own ship".<br>
<br>
1. Create a directory called "UserIcons" in the same place that holds your opencpn.ini(config) file.  <br>
In MSW this is the same folder that holds the log file. Easiest way to find this is to go to the <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/help.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> - button in the ToolBar and look all the way down in the first tab (About).<br>
In Linux create the directory: /home/$USER/.opencpn/UserIcons.<br>
<br>
2.  Add .xpm files to this directory.  They can be any size.  The name  
embedded within the xpm file becomes the name of the new waypoint icon. 
  These new icons will appear on the Waypoint Properties dialog, and can
  be assigned to any waypoint.  They can also be assigned in GPX Import 
 files.<br>
<br>
3. "sredna" has contributed a few nice icons. <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/usericons.zip">Download here.</a> <br>
<em>For anyone interested, I enclose a small package containig some 
24x24px  icons that I find usable: red buoy, red flag, red flag buoy, 
yellow  buoy, yellow flag, yellow buoy flag, blue flag, flag. To use the
  archive, unpack to your UserIcons directory. WARNING: there is no  
folder in the zip file. Feel free to modify/copy/anything with the icons
  as you like. They were created using KolourPaint in case anyone  
wonders.</em><br>
<a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/f134/showthread.php?t=57906">This thread</a> on the forum is all about user contributed Icons.<br>
<br>
4.To replace the default own ship icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/ship_red.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="45" width="19"> , just  put a file "ownship.xpm" in the UserIcons directory, described above.<br>
<br>
<p>You can <strong>create a mark</strong> by right-clicking anywhere in 
the map, and  selecting "Drop Mark Here" from the menu. The mark will 
have a triangle  icon, to change that right-click the icon and select 
"Mark Properties".</p>
<p>You can move the mark by dragging it around.</p>
<p>When creating routes, OpenCPN will ask if it should use a nearby mark if any, when you add a routepoint.</p>
<p>You can delete a mark  by right-clicking its icon, and selecting  
"Delete Mark". Marks can be deleted through the Route Managers Waypoints
 tab as well. Deleting a mark that is part of a route, will also change 
 the route.<br>
The <a href="#Man%20Over%20Board">Man Over Board</a> mark  can be activated through the icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/mob_btn.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32">
  in the toolbar, or through hitting Ctrl + Spacebar. The mark looks 
like  the button and is dropped on present position. This mark cannot be
 moved or deleted  with the cursor or keyboard (by mistake), but can 
still be deleted from the Route/Waypoint manager dialog. More <a href="http://opencpn.org/mob">about MOB here.</a><br>
<br>
A similar kind of locking can be activated for all marks. Goto ToolBox-&gt;Etc.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/lock_wpt_Etc.png" alt="" height="81" width="636"><br>
<br>
and tick the box. This feature is handy, to prevent accidentally moving a
 mark. Activate this feature when underway, deactivate it when planning.</p>
<h5 id="Jump to Position...">Jump to Position...</h5>
In the right-click menu a related feature - Jump to Position - i available.<br>
A small dialog pop up where latitude and longitude can be entered.  
Pressing "OK" centers the display on this position, keeping the same  
scale. The values entered is kept during a session, but goes when  
restarting OpenCPN <br>
<br>
<h3 id="Advanced Mark Feature">Advanced Mark Feature</h3>
<p> Marks can have links to the local file system or the Internet embedded in them.<br>
If this feature is at hand, the line "Additional information" will appear in the right click menu when clicking a waypoint<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/xtra.png" alt="" height="274" width="200"><br>
<br>
Here is an example. A handfull of links to usefull information.<br>

Who will be first with an interactive Cruising Guide for OpenCPN?<br>
<br>
<strong>How to create an embedded link.</strong></p>
<p>This information must (at the moment) be added to the waypoint off 
line. Save the waypoint as a gpx file (export). Then open it in a text 
editor (not Words or similar), edit, save and then import the gpx file.<br>
Below a simple example.To the left before editing, to the right - after. <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/dif.png" alt="" height="203" width="750"></p>
<p>It is of course possible to create waypoints directly in an editor or through a script<br>

<p><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/route.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> Will initiate the creation of a route.  When clicked the cursor changes to a  (<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/pencil2.png" alt="" align="absBottom" height="16" width="31">
 ) pencil. Left click along the desired route you want to make. This 
will leave sequential numbered waypoints as you click along, the numbers
 will only be found in the Route  The numbers are not shown on the chart
 but are available in the Route Manager. The running total distance of 
the whole route will be shown along the "pencil" together with the 
course from the last marked waypoint. <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/route_new.png" alt="" height="330" width="600"><br>
<br>
If your desired route extends off the currently displayed chart, move 
the route cursor in the desired direction and the display will 
automatically pan to show the area.  You can zoom in and out with the 
mouse scroll wheel or keyboard +/- keys during route creating.  You can 
also right click and select 'MAX DETAIL HERE' or 'Scale Out' during 
route creation. When finished right click and choose end route from the 
context menu, alternatively just press the "Esc" key.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/context.png" alt="" align="textTop" height="140" width="174"></p>
<p>The right click menu is context sensitive, exactly what you get 
depend on what sort of chart it is and if quilting is activated, for 
example.<br>
You should now have an inactive (Blue) route.  Active routes are Red, inactivated routes are Blue.<br>
Right clicking on a route brings up a menu with many alternatives, such as "Insert Waypoint" and "Append Waypoint".</p>
<h3 id="Multiple Routes">Multiple Routes </h3>
<p>In OpenCPN multiple routes can be handled in a couple of different ways.<br>
Many routes can be created in a session or imported into a session.<br>
The visibility of every route is controlled in the Route Manager. There 
is an "eye" to the far left on the line for each route. This works as a 
toggle switch.<br>
This way only the route(s) of interest for the moment can be shown.<br>
<br>
Another way is to create and export routes, and later import them when needed.<br>
To keep the chart clear of useful but un-needed routes follow these steps: <br>
• Create a folder called, 'GPX_Routes', or another suitable name.<br>
• Create your route. <br>
• Use the Route Manager to export the route, with a descriptive file name and save it in GPX_Routes.<br>
• Delete the route from the chart.<br>
• You can export all your routes as one big file or export and delete a route as you create them<br>
• When needed, simply use the Route Managers "Import" Button to open the route file. <br>
 </p>
<p>To get rid of the way points left on the chart when a route has been 
imported and then deleted, which may happen depending on the imported 
gpx file.</p>
<p>1. Open the Route Managers Waypoint tab and press the "Delete All" button<br>
2. Say 'Yes' to: 'Are you sure you want to delete &lt;ALL&gt; waypoints?'</p>

    "Unlist Contents" <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/layer22.png" alt="" height="455" width="600">
    <ul>
        <li>Layers are one or more routes, tracks or waypoints  that has
 been saved together in a gpx file. A layer is represented as a single 
gpx file. A layer is persistent and protected from changes. A waypoint 
in a gpx file for example, can be imported either as a "waypoint" or as a
 layer. The difference is that when imported as a layer it cannot be 
changed or deleted.</li>
        <li>Layers are useful for many things. It can for example be used to update <a title="View more discussions on Charts" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/charts.html">charts</a> with new navigation marks and dangers as per Notices to Mariners, and to add <a title="View more discussions on Radio" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/radio.html">Radio</a> Call-In Points or to build a database of lights and locations, that will be visible on <a title="View more discussions on Chart" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/chart.html">chart</a>
 regardless of current scale. See the first picture above. In the second
 picture, a very good celestial fix, plotted with a gpx script has been 
saved as a layer.</li>
        <li>More advanced uses could for example be an interactive 
cruising guide using the possibility to embed links in waypoint 
descriptions.</li>
        <li>Layers can be created in OpenCPN,  and saved as a gpxfile, or be created offline, manually or by scripts, for example.</li>
        <li>Layers that are saved in a directory called "layers", in the
 same place that holds your opencpn.ini(config) file, are automatically 
loaded on start of OpenCPN<br>
        In MSW this is the same folder that holds the log file. Easiest way to find this is to go to the <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/help.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> - button in the ToolBar and look all the way down in the first tab (About).<br>
        In Linux create the directory: /home/$USER/.opencpn/layers. Any 
subdirectory in the layers directory,  is also loaded. To actually 
display these layers on startup, tick the box towards the bottom of the <a href="http://opencpn.org/toolbox">TooBox Etc tab - "Show layers initially"</a>.</li>
        <li>Layers worth keeping, could be kept in the mentioned 
"layers" directory and  visibility during a session can be handled 
through "Hide from Chart" or "Show on Chart" buttons. New layers, gpx 
files, can easily be added in a subdirectory of it's own.</li>
        <li>A few restrictions apply to layer marks. A layer mark cannot
 be used to set anchor-watch on. If right-click-selecting co-located 
objects, priority is given to non-layer objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary layer</strong>: Any gpx file can be 
imported as a  layer. This can be used for developing layers or for 
import from a user  defined directory with predefined layers, as 
necessary. Layers imported  this way will not be saved when closing down
 the computer, but can of  course be loaded again. More permanent layers
 should be kept in the  "layers" directory, as described above.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete: </strong>Unloads the layer, but doesn't of course touch the originally imported gpx file.</li>
        <li><strong>Hide from Chart</strong> or <strong>Show on Chart</strong> Controls if the marked layer is visible. The same thing can be achieved by clicking the "eye" to the left of the layers name.</li>
        <li><strong>Hide WPT Names</strong> Shows a visible layer without waypoint names. This helps to unclutter layers, when zoomed out.</li>
        <li><strong>List contents </strong>or <strong>Delist Contents  </strong>Listing is this context means showing the individual points in the layer as waypoints in the "Waypoints Tab"</li>
        <li><strong>Import GPX..</strong> and <strong>Export All..</strong> <strong>Warning</strong>

How to use split and extend - an example.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt.png" alt="" height="284" width="600"><br>
<br>
Hm...a bit of a miss in the planning. An islet with a shallow bank 
extending southward on our route. We put two marks north of the 
obstruction and would like to include these in our route.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt1.png" alt="" height="438" width="600"><br>
<br>
The waypoint west of the islet is #2. We mark this in "Route 
Properties", from the right-click menu. The Button "Split Route" is 
highlighted, meaning it is available to use. This is exactly what we 
want to do, so we click the button and split the route at wpt #2.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt2.png" alt="" height="245" width="600"><br>
<br>
Right click at #2 and choose "Append Waypoint",<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt3.png" alt="" height="429" width="600"><br>
<br>
Move the cursor to the first triangle, and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Then move the cursor to the second triangle , and answer yes to "Use nearby waypoint?".<br>
Same thing for the original wpt to the east of the islet.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt4.png" alt="" height="114" width="600"><br>
<br>
Click "Activate Route" to see that this extension worked.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt5.png" alt="" height="435" width="600"><br>
<br>
Once again mark  "Route Properties" in the right-click dialog. #3 is the
 last wpt in our "new" temporary route. The "Extend Route" button is 
highlighted, so we click it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt6.png" alt="" height="361" width="600"><br>
<br>
Open the Route Manager to view the result. Notice the naming of the 
routes. _B_plus is active. What remains is to delete route _B and to 
rename _B_plus to a suitable name, for example the name of your original
 route.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt7.png" alt="" height="172" width="600"><br>
<br>
Deleting route _B.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/incwpt8.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
And here is the finally adjusted route.<br>
<br>
This was just an exercise.....in real life, it would be easier to just 
move the existing waypoints in the route, to avoid the Islet.<br>

  <p>The examples shown on this page are all suitable for import as

<h3 id="Creating and Importing Great Circle Routes"><br>
Creating and Importing Great Circle Routes</h3>
GPX import can be used for many things, three sample applications 
follows below. First, look at this picture. Planning a trip from Cape 
Town to Freemantle ?<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/gc.png" alt="" height="414" width="800"><br>
<p>Here you have two imported routes, the Southern route is a pure Great
 Circle, the middle route is a Composite Great Circle, and then the 
normal Rhumb Line furthest to the north.<br>
A Great Circle is the shortest distance between two point on the globe. A
 composite route is the same thing with the additional condition to stay
 below a limiting latitude, in this case 39°30'S. A rhumb line is a 
straight line on a Mercator chart. The Mercator projection is the 
standard for OpenCPN.</p>
Let us compare the distances involved.<br>
<ul>
    <li>The pure great circle is 4610 nautical miles (M)</li>
    <li>The great circle as plotted with 5° of longitude between the waypoints is 4627 M</li>
    <li>The pure composite route, limited by latitude 39°30’ S is 4651M</li>
    <li>The composite route as plotted with 3° of longitude between waypoints (for the great circles) is 4669 M.</li>
    <li>The rhumb  line is 4843 M.</li>
</ul>
So the advantage of a great circle is obvious. The disadvantages, in this case are many.<br>
Colder weather, stronger winds, higher seas and perhaps even icebergs. 
The great circle is just one factor in the decision making when planning
 a route, the weather is likely to be the deciding factor in most cases.<br>
<br>
A great circle route  is created with  the "gc" <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a> script, that is cross platform.<br>
To create a gpx file containing a great circle you have to enter the 
departure points lat &amp; long, followed by the destination points lat 
&amp; long and the optionally a limiting latitude for composite sailing 
and the distance in long between waypoints, default is set to 5°.<br>
<br>
<h3 id="Need to see some offshore weather observations?">Need to see some offshore weather observations?</h3>
<br>
<a href="#"></a><br>
<br>
NOAAs  <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ship_obs.php">NDBC site</a> gives access to a lot of offshore observations from buoys and ships worldwide.<br>
To easy visualize all this data the "ShipWxRep" script transform a 
limited set of all the available data into gpx waypoints. The format, as
 seen above is "wind direction, wind speed, time for observation, and 
air pressure". This can be helpful when evaluating the accuracy of grib 
files, even though the best tool in this respect probably is a 
calibrated digital barometer.<br>
<br>
<h3 id="Plotting Miami Tropical Forecast Advisories.">Plotting Miami Tropical Forecast Advisories.</h3>
If you only have access to low bandwidth Internet, this script is a way 
to quickly plot the contents of, for example an email, containing the 
forecast advisory. In any case, it is a good idea to have the forecast 
track of a tropical system available where you normally do your 
navigation and planning.<br>

  <h1 id="Vector Chart Display" class="book-heading">Vector Chart Display</h1>
  <p><strong>First</strong>, one very important setting for vector charts is handled directly from the main toolbar.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/text.png" alt="" align="absMiddle" height="32" width="32"> This button toggles all text displayed on a vector chart On and Off<br>
 <br>
<strong>Second</strong>, right-clicking on any point on a vector chart 
bring up an information dialog. At the top of this is the "Object Query"
 choice which pops up an information dialog, displaying  the available 
vector-chart attributes at this point. Choose from the menu on the left 
side of the dialog, and watch the details on the right side.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/query2.png" alt="" height="336" width="600"><br>
 <br>
The example is taken from right-clicking on a buoy in a busy area.<br>

<h3 id="Display Categories">Display Categories</h3>
<br>
Navigators has the choice  of three pre-defined, different, 
presentations of ENC content, Base, Standard and Other. OpenCPN also has
 the very flexible Mariners Standard, which is better described as 
"Mariners Choice".<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Base">Base</h4>
Displays general  information, including coastline, safety-contour, isolated danger,<br>
buoy, beacon traffic separation zone, etc.<br>
<br>
From the IMO definitions:<br>
Display Base means the level of SENC information which cannot be removed from<br>
the display, consisting of information which is required at all times in
 all geographic areas and all circumstances. It is not intended to be 
sufficient for safe navigation.<br>
<h4 id="Standard"><br>
Standard</h4>
Everything in "Base" and aids to navigation, fairways, channel limits, restricted navigation zones, restricted areas, etc..<br>
<h4 id="All  Other Information"><br>
All  Other Information</h4>
Everything in "Standard" and more. This level could be described as "all essentials". More about what the <a href="http://opencpn.org/ecdis">the standards</a> says about the content of these three levels.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Mariners Standard">Mariners Standard</h4>
Users can use  the filter tick box to set exactly what he or she wants 
displayed. A large set of filters, about 186, can be employed. They are 
all to the IHO S57 standard, and it is recommended to download <a href="http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-57Ed3.1/31ApAch1.pdf">S-57 Appendix A - IHO Object Catalog</a> and have a copy onboard. Use your pdf viewers "search" or "find" function to quickly find what an acronym means.<br>
Note that Mariners Standard gives the user a much wider choice of what 
to display, than approved ECDIS system are allowed. It is for example 
possible to not display items in the Base category.<br>
<h4 id="WARNING - it is possible to suppress essential information with &quot;Mariners Standard&quot;."><strong>WARNING</strong> - it is possible to suppress essential information with "Mariners Standard".</h4>
<h4 id="If in doubt, switch to &quot;Other&quot;, or use the &quot;Select All&quot; button.">If in doubt, switch to "<strong>Other</strong>", or use the "Select All" button.</h4>

Details can also be found on the Internet:<br>

<a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/0106/0106000000p7000000.htm">help.arcgis.com</a><br>
To illustrate the way of thinking behind  the acronyms, here are a few examples.<br>
<br>
LNDARE  = <strong>L</strong>A<strong>ND</strong><strong>ARE</strong>A<br>
TESARE   = <strong>TE</strong>RITORIAL <strong>S</strong>EA <strong>ARE</strong>A<br>
NAVLNE  <span>=</span> <strong>NAV</strong>IGATION <strong>L</strong>I<strong>NE</strong><br>

SLOTOP = <strong>SLO</strong>PE <strong>TOP</strong>LINE<br>
SLCONS = <strong>S</strong>HORE<strong>L</strong>INE <strong>CONS</strong>TRUCTION<br>
<br>
Each acronym also has an exhaustive official formal definition:
<p id="GUID-D2D0BD79-512F-4D08-BA93-9A20C894C935">DEPCNT = <strong>DEP</strong>TH <strong>C</strong>O<strong>NT</strong>OUR
   A line connecting points of equal water depth which is sometimes 
significantly displaced outside of soundings, symbols and other chart 
detail for clarity as well as generalization. Depth contours, therefor, 
often represent an approximate location of the line of equal depth as 
related to the surveyed line delineated on the source. Also referred to 
as depth curve.<br>

recommendation would be to use "Mariners Standard" and to "Select All", 
to start with, and then switch of certain features as required.</p>
As an example let's look at passing through the British gas fields in the SW North Sea<br>
<br>

<h4 id="ShowSoundings">ShowSoundings</h4>
turns the measured depths on and of. Other settings also affects when 
soundings are displayed, for example SCAMIN. The dark black numbers are 
not soundings. Instead they refer to heights of nearby islets or cays. 
On official paper charts the soundings are printed in italics. <br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/sounding.png" alt="" height="299" width="374"><br>
<br>
The bold number 20 refers to the land height of the unnamed cay SW of the number.<br>
"Safety Depth" is set to 20 m, so all soundings greater than 20 are gray, while those less than 20 are black.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4 id="META objects">META objects</h4>

<br>
<h4 id="Show Important Text Only">Show Important Text Only</h4>
displays only a bare minimum of text essential for navigation, such as 
course and bearing in a leading line (range) and bridge clearances.<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Use SCAMIN">Use SCAMIN</h4>
makes sure that objects are only shown at a relevant <strong>min</strong>imum <strong>sca</strong>le. Without SCAMIN everything is always shown, leading to very cluttered view at small scale (zoomed out). <br>
<br>
<h4 id="Show ATON labels">Show ATON labels</h4>

Even when using SCAMIN there are cases when text labels overlaps or 
overwrites other labels and creates a cluttered impression. Ticking this
 box clears up this mess. To see all the labels, increase the scale for 
the area. <br>
<h3 id="Chart display style"><br>
Chart display style</h3>
<br>
<h4 id="Points">Points</h4>
Paper chart draw the markers and lights just like the printed paper 
chart, while simplified uses icons to represent the same. Some like the 
one and some the other, a matter of taste. <br>
Paper Chart mode closely follows the IHO standard standard in this area.
 This mode is currently more developed than the simplified mode, as it 
has a higher priority in the development effort. <br>
<br>
<h4 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h4>
Plain normally just uses a dashed line, while the Symbolized version also uses triangles pointing into the area.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4 id="Colors">Colors</h4>
Depth on the chart can be displayed with either 2 or 4 colors. This 
setting is closely related to the "Depths Settings". With 2 colors, and 
using a relatively large scale, areas with depth less than "Safety 
Depth" is blue, the rest is white. With 4 colors, there are different 
colors for areas less than "Shallow Depth", areas between "Shallow 
Depth" and "Safety Depth", areas between "Safety Depth" and "Deep Depth"
 and finally for areas deeper than "Deep Depth". <br>
<br>
<h3 id=""> </h3>
<h4 id="CM93 Zoom Detail">CM93 Zoom Detail</h4>
Normal settings depend on a combination of personal preferences and 
present usage of map. To see more detail the "Zoom detail" can be set to
 a higher positive number or for navigation in shipping lanes to a 
negative numbers. Typical zoom level 5 is good for fishing when as much 
details are possible is of interest. Zoom level of +1, zero or -1 is 
usually fine for normal use.<br>
Positive values give more detail, but at a cost:<br>
a.  It simply takes longer to render larger scale charts covering more screen real estate.<br>
b.  There will be more instances of gray (NODATA) areas surrounding the 
larger scale charts as you zoom out, unless quilting is activated.<br>
c.  It can become dramatically slower if high detail is specified, and  
chart outlines are requested.  In this case, the program has to read a 
lot more  cells to get their outlines.<br>
<br>
Conversely, negative values give less detail.  Zooms are faster.<br>
<h3 id="Depth Settings"><br>
Depth Settings</h3>
Controls the coloring of the water as a function of depth. By setting 
the Safety and Deep water right you will have a visible border to show 
when to take care about shallow water.  <br>
CM93 charts and S57 ENCS works very similar in this area.The charts 
contains depth area features according to fixed depth cutoff zones, 
usually 5, 10, and 20 meters. Intermediate values are not available in 
the database,if you select a value between those available, opencpn 
chooses the next higher value available for display of color. <br>
The charts are inconsistent in this area, depending on the country 
issuing the original  charts. For example in UK and the Netherlands the 
depth contours in CM93 are 2, 5 and 10 meter while in Sweden they are 3,
 6 and 10 meter!<br>
Generally for both S57 ENC and CM93, find these fixed depth cutoffs by 
right clicking -&gt; Object Query -&gt;Chart -&gt; Depth Area. The two 
values DRVAL1 and DRVAL2 represents these built in cutoffs.<br>
If for example, as is the case on the South China Sea Hydrographic 
Commissions charts, the shallowest area has a   DRVAL1 = 0 m and a 
DRVAL2 = 10 m, there is, in most cases, no point in setting "Shallow 
Depth" to anything but 10 m.<br>
Find out these cut off depth for your area and set the "Depth Settings" 
with this knowledge together with your preferences and activity. <br>
<br>
With all the reservations above, the general case for 4 colors, will be described.
<h4 id="Shallow Depth"><br>
<br>
Shallow Depth</h4>
will color all water areas with water depths shallower than the set depth to a dark blue color.Soundings are in black.<br>
<h4 id="Safety Depth"><br>
Safety Depth</h4>
water deeper that Shallow but shallower that this depth will have a 
paler blue color. The  Shallow Depth contour clearly marked with dark 
gray borderline.Soundings less than this depth are in black, while 
soundings greater than this value are gray.<br>
<h4 id="Deep Depth"><br>
Deep Depth</h4>
water deeper than Safety Depth but less than Deep Depth will display a 
light gray color.      The  Safety Depth contour  is clearly marked with
 black borderline. Water deeper than Deep Depth is displayed in white.<br>
<br>
<strong>Finally</strong> a word about <strong>drying heights</strong>, 
displayed in green. There is no detailed information available for the 
value of the drying heights, neither in CM93 ver 2 nor in most S57 
charts, currently available for OpenCPN. Raster charts seems to be the 
only alternative for navigation in shallow areas with a large tide. <br>
<br>

When is safe to pass across Bramble Bank? The Vectorchart gives us no 
information whatsoever , neither on the chart, nor in the Object Query 
dialog.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/bramb.png" alt="" height="325" width="600"><br>

  <h1 id="CM93 Offsets" class="book-heading">CM93 Offsets</h1>
  <br>
To use this feature.
<ul>
    <li>Go to single chart (i.e. non-quilted) mode, with cm93 charts displayed. Use F9 to flip quilting on and off</li>
    <li>Zoom/Pan to the region of interest.</li>
    <li>Right click and activate "CM93 Offset Dialog"</li>
</ul>
  <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/offsets1.png" alt="" border="20" height="314" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="235"><br>
<ul>
    <li>In the list of cells/MCOVR IDs, selected the one MCOVR of 
interest.    The coverage area for this MCOVR object will be outlined 
with a heavy  yellow border.</li>
    <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/offsets2.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
    <br>
    <li>Some cells have built in corrections already applied. The values
 wgsox and wgsoy, are offsets to bring the original chart cell to WGS84.
 See the first and third cell in the picture above. The values are for 
information only, and cannot be changed. These corrections are generally
 correct, but not always. Sometimes the corrections are wrong and 
sometimes there are no corrections where there ought to be. This is 
where this manual offset feature comes in handy.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In order to use this feature effectively, one needs a geographically  
known reference point.  As an example, say there is a NAVAID present on 
 the <a title="View more discussions on Chart" class="sk_tag" href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/tags/chart.html">chart</a>
  cell with known WGS84 lat &amp; long, as from a light list.  In this 
case, one  can drop a waypoint on the chart, edit the waypoint 
properties to the  known lat/lon, and then use the CM93 Offset Dialog to
 slew the  cell/MCOVR so that the dropped waypoint coincides with the 
NAVAID  feature on the cm93 cell (chart).<br>
<br>
You may also use a geographical feature such as a Cape or point whose  
location is absolutely known, as by reference to observation, or by  
rendering on another, more accurate chart such as a trusted scanned  
raster chart or georeferenced photo chart.<br>
<br>
To see how this feature works, here is an example from the South Pacific.<br>
<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/offsets4.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800"><br>
This is Tongareva, also called Penhryn atoll. A mark, with a triangle is dropped at the westernmost point of the Island.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/offsets5.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Zooming
 out to next smaller scale chart makes the triangle mark jump NNE. Time 
for some corrections, as we, at least for the purpose of this example, 
are confident that the larger scale chart is correct.<br>
<img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/offsets6.png" alt="" border="20" height="607" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="800">Quite large corrections brings the chart into reasonable agreement.  <br>
<ul>
    <li>Use the spin controls on the right side of the dialog to adjust 
the desired user offsets. It is also possible to write numbers directly.
 Notice that positive corrections is towards North and East.</li>
    <li>In some cases it is not clear exactly which M_COVR ID that 
represents your position. A simple test will reveal if a mark reacts to 
(large) corrections.</li>
    <li>The offsets are automatically saved in the binary MCOVR cache files found in the program data directory as CM93/...</li>

  <h1 id="Navigation Data Backup" class="book-heading">Navigation Data Backup</h1>
  Navigation data backup is implemented in 2.5. Rotating backups of 
navobejcts created on every program run. OpenCPN keeps backups of the 
last 5 runs. This can be changed.<br>
In the opencpn.ini/opencpn.config file you can find a configuration 
setting to control the number of backups kept, defaulting to <b>KeepNavobjBackups=5. </b>This value can be changed using a text editor.<br>
The backups are then stored in files navobj.xml.[1..x] (in the same 
directory as the ni file) where .1 is  always the newest backup and the 
oldest is removed on the next program  run. The file that will be loaded
 on next start is called navobj.xml.<br>
To load an old backup, exit the program. Find the backup you want to use. Rename it  navobj.xml. Start OpenCPN!<br>
<br>
The OpenCPN logfile also serves as a backupb through the "LOGBOOK:" entries.<br>
These can be used to reconstruct a  GPX track. A windows utility for hat purpose ia available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads">https://github.com/nohal/LogBookExtractor/downloads</a>  </div>

  The core OpenCPN tries to keep features to a minimum so that it is 
lean, mean and easy to use. Features can still be added through the 
plugin infrastructure. The plugin interface has changed in the 
development of version 2.5. The plugins must use PlugIn API version to 
1.5 to work with OpenCPN 2.5 (compiled using 2.4.523 or later).<br>
A number of new plugins are introduced with the 2.5 release.<br>

  <h1 id="GRIB Weather PlugIn" class="book-heading">GRIB Weather PlugIn</h1>
  OpenCPN has a lightweight grib weather file viewer plugin, with a 
limited set of features, aimed at being useful while under way. It is 
not possible to download grib files from within OpenCPN. Many external 
sources for grib files are available on the Internet.  <a href="http://weather.mailasail.com/Franks-Weather/Grib-Files-Getting-And-Using">Franks-Weather </a> is a good starting point.<br>
<ul>
    <li>To display grib files as an overlay on your normal charts you have to first activate the grib icon <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/grib.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"></li>
    <li>Go to <img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/settings.png" alt="" height="32" width="32"> find the plugin tab. Click on the Grib plugin, then the "Enable" button. The "Prefence" Button brings up a small dialog. <br>
    <p><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/grib-plugin.png" alt="" height="712" width="600"></p>
    </li>
    <li>Tick the "Show GRIB Icon" box. Tick the next box as well, unless
 you are on old hardware. Not ticking the "High Definition Graphics" box
 can help to speed up the grib display, in such cases.</li>
    <li><img src="OpenCPN_User_Manual_files/grib2.png" alt="" height="663" width="650"></li>
    <li>The Next step is to click the icon, which brings up the Grib 
Display Control. Use the upper part of this window to navigate to, and 
select your grib files. The grib files will then be appear in the 
control. See picture above.</li>
    <li>Click on the "&gt;" in front of the gribfile. The individual 
forecasts contained in the gribfile, is then displayed under the 
gribfile heading.</li>
    <li>Click on one of the forecasts and it will be displayed. When you
 move the cursor over the grib display, the values for wind etc will be 
displayed for the cursor position, in the lower part of the "Grib 
Display Control". Here you can select what grib values to view. Note 
that not all gribfiles contains wave data.</li>
    <li>OpenCPN will display most grib file formats, but as it is a fairly new feature, bug reports are very welcome.</li>

    <li>If you are not familiar with grib weather files, make sure you 
understand the basics, before you start to use them. It is essential to 
understand the limitations of weather forecasts in the grib format. It 
is also worth pointing out that gribs are <strong>not</strong> reliable near tropical systems.</li>

  The Dashboard pluging is able to show quite a few instruments. If the 
data is available to OpenCPN in the NMEA0183 data stream the different 
instruments will display relevant data. But...the plugin don't tell what
 is available. It is assumed that the user know what is connected. It is
 of course possible to activate all instruments and see what works.<br>

the top Caption bar with the cursor and drag the Dashboard as far as 
possible to the right or left. Let go the cursor, and the Dashboard will
 dock, the chart display will adjust, no part of the chart will be 
hidden. Horizontal Dashboards can in a similar way be docked top or 
bottom.<br>
This process is reversible. Just grab the Dashboard dialog bar with the 
cursor, an pull towards the middle of the screen, and the Dashboard will

<p>Do you have a bunch of scanned charts of your area, in graphical format (jpg, tiff, etc.) and OpenCPN won't read them?<br>
Here's how you can – with a bit of work, sure, but worth the effort – convert them into usable electronic charts.</p>
<h4 id="The tools:">The tools:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ImageMagick: <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/" title="http://www.imagemagick.org/">http://www.imagemagick.org/</a>
 (Binary releases are available for a few distributions, for Ubuntu just
 get it with the package manager, it's in the repositories.)</li>
    <li>Libbsb: <a href="http://libbsb.sourceforge.net/" title="http://libbsb.sourceforge.net">http://libbsb.sourceforge.net</a>
 (You will need some version of libtiff-dev and libpng-dev installed to 
build it. A .deb package that worked fine for me can be found <a href="http://opencpn.org/libbsb">here</a>.</li>
    <li>mc2bsbh: you can get it <a href="http://www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/mapcal/index.html">here</a>.<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Get the c++ source file, and from its directory, type:</li>
        <li>g++ -Wall -s -O2 mc2bsbh.cpp -o mc2bsbh</li>
        <li>It compiled without any problem on my (very standard) 
Karmic. I personally put it in /usr/local/bin, which I own as user, so 
it's in the PATH and can be called from anywhere, if you leave it in the
 working directory, use ./mc2bsbh</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>MapCal: part of the free navigation package SeaClear .<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Note: I had some problems running it with Wine (saving the 
calibration) but I can't reproduce the error and now it works fine. One 
suggestion is, make the directory you're going to write the calibration 
in world-writable before running MapCal.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The pcx2tif script (optional) , found <a href="http://opencpn.org/sites/default/files/users/taifun/pcx2tif.zip">here</a>.
  This is a great little shell script by "taifun" used to convert old 
Maptech-style formats of tiled charts. If you find your chart is made of
 little bits instead of a whole file, this will stitch them all together
 in TIFF format.
    <ol>
        <li>Instructions for use are in the tarball.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Once we have the tools all set up, we can get to work. <strong>The process in in five steps:</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Convert a chart image to tiff with imagemagick.</li>
    <li>Convert it again to png with the same (you'll need both files).</li>
    <li>Load the png version of the chart in Mapcal and calibrate it.</li>
    <li>Generate the chart header with mc2bsbh, and make the .kap version of the chart, with libbsb.</li>
    <li>Copy the resulting .kap into opencpn's chart dir, and reload the chart database.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Let's see them in detail:</strong></p>
<p><u>Steps 1 and 2:</u><br>
<br>
Say you have a chart in jpeg format called chart.jpg.<br>
<br>
From the command line, use:<br>
 convert chart.jpg -colors 127 chart.gif<br>
<br>
and then again,<br>
 convert chart.gif -colors 127 chart.tif<br>
<br>
and then again,<br>
 convert chart.jpg -colors 127 chart.png<br>
<br>
(there is a script that does this for multiple files, get it <a href="http://www.cruisersforum.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=12502&amp;d=1263164543">here</a>  , just remove the .doc extension, this is the example)<br>
Throw away the .gif file. Don't ask me why you need to generate it in 
the first place, but apparently you do, it's an imagemagick thing. Keep 
the .tif and the .png ones a while longer, though. You'll be even 
happier to get rid of them when you've finished.</p>
<p><u>Step 3:</u></p>
<ul>
    <li>Open MapCal.</li>
    <li>File, Open Image. Open the .png version of your chart. Ignore 
the data window for the moment, you'll do that later, click OK. You 
should see your chart.</li>
    <li>To calibrate it, choose a point near a corner for which it is 
easy to know lat/lon. Right-click on it, and choose Add New Cal. Point. 
To zoom in and out use the little + and – buttons at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Ignore the fact that Latitude has three integer figures, we're 
still talking about the Earth. Enter the coordinates and proceed for at 
least three more points, near the corners.</li>
    <li>Click Activate Changes. Check that the grid makes sense. Click Border, draw a border around the chart (that part is easy).</li>
    <li>You should also enter some data for the chart: Edit, Chart Information.</li>
    <li>The Chart Name will show up in OpenCPN to remind you of all your hard work, choose it well.</li>
    <li>For this example we'll just use “chart”.</li>
    <li>You should also enter at least Scale (found on the chart) Depth 
Units, Projection (Mercator most likely) and Datum (WGS84 most likely, 
but be careful with older charts). All of this information should be 
found on the chart itself.</li>
    <li>For more details, you have the SeaClear Manual.</li>
    <li>File, Save Calibration. Repeat ad-lib for any other charts and 
exit. If everything went well, you'll find a file called CHARTCAL.DIR in
 the same directory as you loaded your png chart from. This is used to 
(finally) make your calibrated chart that OpenCPN will use, as detailed 
in</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Step 4:</u></p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate the chart header from the command line:
    <ul>
        <li>mc2bsbh CHARTCAL.DIR</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should see:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Create CHART.hdr  <br>(the .hdr file must have DOS newlines)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>So type: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>tif2bsb -c 127 CHART.hdr chart.tif chart.kap</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>At which point you should have a chart.kap file that OpenCPN will happily use. <br>
    <ul>         This can be done for many charts at a time by using the <a href="http://www.dacust.com/inlandwaters/mapcal/mc2bsbh/tif2bsb_batch.sh">tif2bsb batch script</a> from the mc2bsbh page. If it gives you any problem with lowercase-uppercase names, try: <br>
        <strong><span>for i in `find * -depth`; do (mv $i `echo $i|tr [:upper:] [:lower:]`); done</span></strong><br>
        which will convert all files in the current directory to lowercase (works great for me).<br>
        If you get an error like /bin/bash^M, no such shell (I did), 
it's a cr/lf thing, just edit it, type [enter] at the end of each line 
(there's only 7) and get rid of the blank ones.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
        <ul>Proceed to install the filename(s).kap into OpenCPN (see<a href="http://opencpn.org/installing_charts"> installing charts</a>) </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note 1: you can also make the .hdr file “manually”, using
 a template and entering the calibration data with a text editor, but I 
won't go into that for the moment.</em></p>
        <p><em>Note 2 (about the commands, so if there's any problem you know what to look for) :</em></p>
        <ol>             <strong><em>convert </em></strong><em>is a command from imagemagick.</em> <br>
            <strong><em>tif2bsb</em></strong><em> is a command from libbsb.</em><br>
            <strong><em>mc2bsbh</em></strong><em> is a standalone thing.</em>         </ol>
            <p><em>Note 3: (by Jonasberg, on the colors in the conversions) :</em></p>
            <ol>             <em>The "127" is the number of individual 
colors used. Sometimes it pays of to reduce this number to get a smaller
 file size, say, if you start with a bitmapped format like png that 
contains fewer colors.</em>         </ol>
                Note 4: On the joinpcx script:<br>
                <br>
                If you use it "standalone" and not as part of the "charts" script,  change the lines,<br>
                <span>convert new1.gif - colors 127 $1.tif<br>
                <span>(and .png) to</span><br>
                convert new1.gif -colors 127 `basename $PWD`.tif</span><br>
                (and .png) <br>
                because the "$1" will not create files with [directory_name].tif and .png, it won't create any files at all.<br>
                Using `basename $PWD`will make files called [current directory name].tif (and .png).<br>
                So just edit the script to whatever suits you best. <br>  </div>

  <h1 id="FAQ" class="book-heading">FAQ</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Where is my log file? </strong><strong>Where is my config.ini file?</strong> <a href="http://opencpn.org/installing_opencpn#log-config">Read this explanation</a>.!</li>
    <li><strong>What are all those 'U' things all over my chart?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature being rendered is S57 Text relating to 'M_QUAL'.</p>
<p>This is a meta-object describing the quality of data shown. The 
Attribute of interest is CATZOC, or "Category of Zone of Confidence". 
The value on most US ENC's is "6", or "un-assessed". Thus, the 'U'.</p>
<p>You can turn this symbol off in OpenCPN by de-selecting the box next 
to M_QUAL in 'Tool Box' / 'Vector Charts' tab 'Mariners Standard' 
selection list box.</p>
<p>To learn the acronyms used in this application search the S57 'Object and Attribute' catalog at: <a href="http://www.s-57.com/" title="http://www.s-57.com/">http://www.s-57.com/</a></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>I have routes and way points in Sea Clear and I would like to import them into OpenCPN. Can I do it?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes. I had originally created and maintained all my routes and 
waypoints in SeaClear, exported them, loaded them into GPSUtility (for 
Windows) and saved them as text files.</p>
<p>To import into OpenCPN  I opened all my text files (routes and 
waypoints) with GPSUtility, saved that out as one big gpx file, and 
loaded it into OpenCPN. Works like a champ.</p>
<p>I've edited them and saved them back out as GPX files with no trouble.</p>
<p>Individual routes can be edited and saved in appropriately named GPX files.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Whenever I try to open a particular chart OpenCPN crashes. What's going on?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Chances are the chart file is corrupted. Note the name and number of the suspect chart and replace it with a fresh download.</p>
<p>NOTE: A list of the charts with their names and file names can be 
found in the README.TEXT that accompanies the charts downloaded from 
NOOA.</p>
<p>Some unzip utilities for Linux are problematic when opening ECN's. If
 there are many corrupt charts in your download, try using a different 
unzip utility.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>OpenCPN and Great Circle Navigation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Raster charts display bearings and headings as straight, measurable 
lines on the chart. Similarly, Vector ENC's are rendered as Mercator 
projections in OpenCPN and most other ECS's for the same reason.</p>
<p>For typical coastal navigation, errors which occur using rhumb line 
instead of great circle calculations are small for the distances usually
 covered by one chart.</p>
<p>Mercator Charts and Mercator navigation is the standard for most 
navigational purposes. Other terms used instead of "Mercator Sailing" is
 "Loxodrome Sailing" or "Rhumb Line Sailing".</p>
<p>OpenCPN uses Mercator Sailing and cannot directly display Great 
Circles, but through GPX route import , Great Circle Routes can be used 
as explained on <a href="#Planning%20Data">Planning Data</a> page in the wiki.</p>
